<p>What fantastic tricks are played by fate
or circumstance! Here is a horrible war
that shall redeem a nation, that shall restore
civilization, that shall establish Christianity.
Here is a university of slavery that shall
lead the savage to citizenship. Here is a
conflagration that shall rebuild a city.
Here is the stroke of a pen that shall change
the destinies of many peoples. Here is the
bundle of fagots that shall light the fires of
liberty. As in great things, so in small.
Tragedy drags comedy across the stage, and
hard upon the heels of the hero tread the
heavy villain and the painted clown.</p>

<p>What a preface to write before the name
of Billville!</p>

<p>Years ago, when one of the ex-Virginian
pioneers who had settled in Wilkes County,
in the State of Georgia, concluded to try his
fortune farther west, he found himself, after
a tedious journey of a dozen days, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
midst of a little settlement in middle Georgia.
His wagons and his negroes were at
once surrounded by a crowd of curious but
good-humored men and a swarm of tow-headed
children.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” he asked one of
the group.</p>

<p>“Bill Jones.”</p>

<p>“And yours?” turning to another.</p>

<p>“Bill Satterlee.”</p>

<p>The group was not a large one, but in addition
to Jones and Satterlee, as the newcomer
was informed, Bill Ware, Bill Cosby,
Bill Pinkerton, Bill Pearson, Bill Johnson,
Bill Thurman, Bill Jessup, and Bill Prior
were there present, and ready to answer to
their names. In short, fate or circumstance
had played one of its fantastic pranks in this
isolated community, and every male member
of the settlement, with the exception of Laban
Davis, who was small and puny-looking,
bore the name of Bill.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the pioneer, who was not
without humor, “I’ll pitch my tent in Billville.
My name is Bill Cozart.”</p>

<p>This is how Billville got its name—a
name that has clung to it through thick and
thin. A justifiable but futile attempt was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
made during the war to change the name of
the town to Panola, but it is still called
Billville, much to the disappointment of
those citizens who have drawn both pride
and prosperity in the lottery of life.</p>

<p>It was a fortunate day for Billville when
Mr. William Cozart, almost by accident,
planted his family tree in the soil of the settlement.
He was a man of affairs, and at
once became the leading citizen of the place.
His energy and public spirit, which had
room for development here, appeared to be
contagious. He bought hundreds of acres
of land, in the old Virginia fashion, and
made for himself a home as comfortable as
it was costly. His busy and unselfish life
was an example for his neighbors to follow,
and when he died the memory of it was a
precious heritage to his children.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Billville, stirred into action
by his influence, grew into a thrifty village,
and then into a flourishing town; but
through all the changes the Cozarts remained
the leading family, socially, politically,
and financially. But one day in the
thirties Berrien Cozart was born, and the
wind that blew aside the rich lace of his
cradle must have been an ill one, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
child grew up to be a thorn in the side of
those who loved him best. His one redeeming
quality was his extraordinary beauty.
This has, no doubt, been exaggerated; but
there are still living in Billville many men
and women who knew him, and they will
tell you to-day that Berrien Cozart was the
handsomest man they have ever seen—and
some of them have visited every court in
Europe. So far as they are concerned, the
old saying, “Handsome is that handsome
does,” has lost its force. They will tell you
that Berrien Cozart was the handsomest man
in the world and—probably the worst.</p>

<p>He was willful and wrongheaded from the
first. He never, even as a child, acknowledged
any authority but his own sweet
will. He could simulate obedience whenever
it suited his purpose, but only one
person in the world had any real influence
over him—a negro named Balaam. The
day Berrien Cozart was born, his proud and
happy father called to a likely negro lad
who was playing about in the yard—the
day was Sunday—and said:—</p>

<p>“How old are you?”</p>

<p>“I dunno ’zackly, marster, but ole Aunt
Emmeline she know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you do any work?”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh; I totes water, an’ I drives de
cows ter de pastur’, an’ I keeps off de calfs,
an’ I runs de chickens out ’n de gyardin.”</p>

<p>The sprightly and intelligent appearance
of the lad evidently made a favorable impression
on the master, for he beckoned to
him and said:—</p>

<p>“Come in here; I want to show you
something.”</p>

<p>The negro dropped his hat on the ground
and followed Mr. Cozart, who led the way
to the darkened room where Berrien, the
baby, was having his first experience with
existence. He lay on the nurse’s lap, with
blinking eyes and red and wrinkled face,
trying to find his mouth with his fists. The
nurse, black as she was, was officious, and
when she saw the negro boy she exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“Balaam, w’at you doin’ in yere? Take
yo’se’f right out! Dis ain’t no place fer
you.”</p>

<p>“Marster says so,” said Balaam, sententiously.</p>

<p>“Balaam,” said Mr. Cozart, “this baby
will be your master. I want you to look
after him and take care of him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” said Balaam, regarding his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
new master with both interest and curiosity.
“He look like he older dan w’at he is.”
With that Balaam retreated to the negro
quarters, where he had a strange tale to tell
the other children about the new white
baby.</p>

<p>Berrien grew and thrived, and when he
was a year old Balaam took charge of him,
and the two soon became devoted to each
other. The negro would take the child on
his back and carry him from one end of the
plantation to the other, and Berrien was
never happy unless Balaam was somewhere
in sight. Once, when it was found necessary
to correct Balaam with a switch for
some boyish offense, his young master fell
on the floor in a convulsion of rage and
grief. This manifestation made such an
impression on the family that no further
attempt was ever made to punish Balaam;
and so the two grew up together—the
young master with a temper of extreme violence
and an obstinacy that had no bounds,
and the negro with an independence and a
fearlessness extremely rare among slaves.</p>

<p>It was observed by all, and was a cause
of special wonder among the negroes, that,
in spite of Berrien Cozart’s violent temper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
he never turned his hand against Balaam,
not even when he was too young to reason
about the matter. Sometimes, when he was
seen throwing stones in a peculiarly vicious
way at a tree, or at the chickens, or at
some of the other children, the older negroes
would laughingly shake their heads at one
another and say that the child was mad with
Balaam.</p>

<p>These queer relations between master and
slave grew stronger as the two grew older.
When Berrien was ten and Balaam twenty
they were even more inseparable than they
had been when the negro was trudging about
the plantation with his young master on his
back. At that time Balaam was not allowed
to sleep in the big house; but when
Berrien was ten he had a room to himself,
and the negro slept on a pallet by the side
of the bed.</p>

<p>About this time it was thought necessary
to get a private tutor for Berrien. He had
a great knack for books in a fitful sort of
way, but somehow the tutor, who was an estimable
young gentleman from Philadelphia,
was not very much to Berrien’s taste. For
a day or two matters went along smoothly
enough, but it was not long before Balaam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
lying on the floor outside the door, heard a
tremendous racket and clatter in the room.
Looking in, he saw his young master pelting
the tutor with books and using language
that was far from polite. Balaam went in,
closing the door carefully behind him, and
almost immediately the tumult ceased.
Then the negro appeared leading his young
master by the arm. They went downstairs
and out on the lawn. The tutor, perplexed
and astonished by the fierce temper of his
pupil, saw the two from the window and
watched them curiously. Berrien finally
stopped and leaned against a tree. The negro,
with his hand on the boy’s shoulder,
was saying something unpleasant, for the
tutor observed one or two fierce gestures of
protest. But these soon ceased, and presently
Berrien walked rapidly back to the
house, followed by Balaam. The tutor
heard them coming up the stairway; then
the door opened, and his pupil entered and
apologized for his rudeness.</p>

<p>For some time there was such marked improvement
in Berrien’s behavior that his tutor
often wondered what influence the negro
had brought to bear on his young master;
but he never found out. In fact, he soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
forgot all about the matter, for the improvement
was only temporary. The youngster
became so disagreeable and so unmanageable
that the tutor was glad to give up his position
at the end of the year. After that
Berrien was sent to the Academy, and there
he made considerable progress, for he was
spurred on in his studies by the example of
the other boys. But he was a wild youth,
and there was no mischief, no matter how
malicious it might be, in which he was not
the leader. As his character unfolded itself
the fact became more and more manifest
that he had an unsavory career before him.
Some of the older heads predicted that he
would come to the gallows, and there was
certainly some ground for these gloomy suggestions,
for never before had the quiet community
of Billville given development to
such reckless wickedness as that which
marked the daily life of Berrien Cozart as
he grew older. Sensual, cruel, impetuous,
and implacable, he was the wonder of the
mild-mannered people of the county, and a
terror to the God-fearing. Nevertheless, he
was attractive even to those who regarded
him as the imp of the Evil One, and many
a love-lorn maiden was haunted by his beautiful
face in her dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>When Berrien was eighteen he was sent
to Franklin College at Athens, which was
supposed to divide the responsibility of
guardianship with a student’s parents. The
atmosphere the young man found there in
those days suited him admirably. He became
the leader of the wildest set at that
venerable institution, and proceeded to make
a name for himself as the promoter and organizer
of the most disreputable escapades
the college had ever known. He was an
aggressor in innumerable broils, he fought
a duel in the suburbs of Athens, and he
ended his college career by insulting the
chancellor in the lecture-room. He was expelled,
and the students and the people of
Athens breathed freer when it was known
that he had gone home never to return.</p>

<p>There was a curious scene with his father
when the wayward youth returned to Billville
in disgrace. The people of that town
had received some inkling of the sort of
education the young man was getting at
college, though Mr. Cozart was inclined to
look somewhat leniently on the pranks of his
son, ascribing them to the hot blood of
youth. But when Berrien’s creditors began
to send in their accounts, amounting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
several thousands of dollars, he realized for
the first time that the hope and pride of his
later years had been vain delusions. Upon
the heels of the accounts came Berrien himself,
handsomer and more attractive than
ever. Dissipation was not one of his vices,
and he returned with the bloom of youth on
his cheek and the glowing fires of health in
his sparkling eyes. He told the story of his
expulsion with an air as gay as any cavalier
ever assumed. The story was told at the
table, and there was company present. But
this fact was ignored by Berrien’s father.
His hand shook as he laid down his knife
and fork.</p>

<p>“You have damaged my credit,” he said
to his son across the table; “you have disgraced
your mother’s name and mine; and
now you have the impudence to make a joke
of it at my table, sir. Let me not see your
face in this house again until you have returned
to college and wiped out the blot you
have placed on your name.”</p>

<p>“As you please, sir,” said Berrien. His
eyes were still full of laughter, but some of
those who were at the table said his nether
lip trembled a little. He rose, bowed, and
passed out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Balaam was in his young master’s room
when the latter went in. He had unpacked
the trunk and the valise and was placing the
things in a clothes-press, meanwhile talking
with himself, as most negroes will when left
to themselves. Berrien entered, humming
the tune of a college glee.</p>

<p>“I ’lowed you was at dinner, Marse
Berry,” said Balaam.</p>

<p>“I have finished,” said young Cozart.
“Have you had yours?”</p>

<p>“Lord! no, suh. Hit’ll be ’way yander
todes night ’fo’ I kin git dese clo’es straightened
out.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the young man, “you go
and get your dinner as soon as you can.
This valise must be repacked. Before the
sun goes down we must be away from here.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord, Marse Berry! I ain’t said
howdy wid none er de folks yit. How
come we got ter go right off?”</p>

<p>“You can stay, if you choose,” said Berrien.
“I reckon you’d be a better negro if
you had stayed at home all the time. Right
now you ought to be picking your five hundred
pounds of cotton every day.”</p>

<p>“Now, you know, Marse Berry, dat of
you er gwine, I’m gwine too—you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
dat p’intedly; but you come in on me so
sudden-like dat you sorter git me flustrated.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Berrien, seating himself on
the side of the bed and running his fingers
through his curling hair, “if you go with
me this time you will be taking a big jump
in the dark. There’s no telling where
you’ll land. Pap has taken the studs, and
I have made up my mind to leave here for
good and all. You belong to me, but I’ll
give you your choice; you can go with me,
or you can stay. If you go, I’ll probably
get into a tight place and sell you; if you
stay, Pap will make a pet of you for my
sake.”</p>

<p>Regarding this as a very good offhand
joke, the young man laughed so loud that the
sound of it penetrated to the dining-room,
and, mellow and hearty as it was, it struck
strangely on the ears of those still sitting at
the table.</p>

<p>“I knowed in reason dat dey was gwine
to be a rippit,” said Balaam; “kaze you
know how you been gwine on up yander,
Marse Berry. I tole an’ tole you ’bout it,
an’ I dunno whar in de name er goodness
you’d been ef I hadn’t been right dar fer
ter look atter you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” remarked Berrien, sarcastically,
“you were just about drunk enough half the
time to look after me like a Dutch uncle.”</p>

<p>Balaam held his head down and chuckled.
“Yes, suh,” he said, “I tuck my dram, dey
ain’t no ’sputin’ er dat; yit I never has tuck
so much dat I ain’t keep my eye on you.
But ’t ain’t do no good: you des went right
’long; an’ dar was ole Mistiss, which she
done sick in bed, an’ Miss Sally Carter,
which she’s yo’ born cousin—dar dey all
was a-specktin’ you ter head de whole school
gang. An’ you did head ’em, mon, but not
in de books.”</p>

<p>“My fair Cousin Sarah!” exclaimed Berrien
in a reminiscent way.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh,” said Balaam; “an’ dey tells
me down in de kitchen dat she comin’ yere
dis ve’y day.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said the young man, “it is time
for me to be going. Get your dinner. If
I am to have your company, you must be
ready in an hour; if you want to stay, go
to the overseer and tell him to put you to
work.”</p>

<p>Laughing good-naturedly, Balaam slipped
out. After a little while Berrien Cozart
went down the stairway and into the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of his mother, who was an invalid. He sat
at her bedside and talked a few moments.
Then he straightened and smoothed her pillows,
stroked her gray hair, gazed into her
gentle eyes, and kissed her twice. These
things the poor lady remembered long afterwards.
Straying into the spacious parlor,
the young man looked around on the familiar
furniture and the walls covered with
portraits. Prominent among these was the
beautiful face of Sally Carter. The red
curtains in the windows, swaying to and fro
in the wind, so swiftly changed the light and
shadow that the fair face in the heavy gilt
frame seemed to be charged with life. The
lustrous eyes seemed to dance and the saucy
lips to smile. Berrien remembered his fair
cousin with pleasure. She had been his
playmate when he was younger, and the impression
she made on him had been a lasting
one. Beautiful as she was, there was
no nonsense about her. She was high-spirited
and jolly, and the young man
smiled as he recalled some of their escapades
together. He raised his hand to salute
the portrait, and at that moment a peal
of merry laughter greeted his ears. Turning,
he saw framed in the doorway the rosy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
original of the portrait. Before he could
recover from his astonishment the young
lady had seized and kissed him. Then she
held him off at arm’s length and looked at
him.</p>

<p>“Why, how handsome you have grown;”
she cried. “Just think of it! I expected
to meet a regular border ruffian. My dear
boy, you have no idea what a tremendous
reputation your friends have given you.
Ann Burney—you remember that funny
little creature, don’t you? as fat as a butterball—Ann
told me the other day that you
were positively the terror of everybody
around Athens. And now I find you here
kissing your fingers at my portrait on the
wall. I declare, it is too romantic for anything!
After this I know you will never
call me Sarah Jane.”</p>

<p>“You have taken me by surprise,” said
Berrien, as soon as he could get in a word.
“I was admiring the skill of the artist. The
lace there, falling against the velvet bodice,
is neatly done.”</p>

<p>“Ah, but you are blushing; you are confused!”
exclaimed Miss Carter. “You
haven’t even told me you are glad to see
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“There is no need to tell you that,” said
Berrien. “I was just thinking, when you
rushed in on me, how good and kind you
always were. You are maturer than the
portrait there, but you are more beautiful.”</p>

<p>Miss Carter bent low with a mock courtesy,
but the color in her face was warmer
as she exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“Oh, how nice you are! The portrait
there is only sixteen, and I am twenty-five.
Just think of that! And just think of me
at that age—what a tomboy I was! But I
must run and tell the rest of the folks
howdy.”</p>

<p>Berrien Cozart walked out on the veranda,
and presently he was joined by his father.
“My son,” said the old gentleman, “you
will need money for your traveling expenses.
Here is a check on our Augusta factor; you
can have it cashed in Madison. I want you
to return to college, make all proper apologies,
and redeem yourself.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Berrien, taking
the check and stuffing it into his pocket.
His father turned to go indoors, hesitated a
moment, and looked at Berrien, who was
drumming idly on one of the pillars. Then
the old gentleman sighed and went in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly thereafter Berrien Cozart and
Balaam were journeying away from Billville
in the conveyance that had brought them
there.</p>

<p>On the high hill beyond the “town
branch” Balaam leaned out of the hack and
looked back at Billville. The town appeared
insignificant enough; but the setting
sun imparted a rosy glow to the roof of the
yellow court-house and to the spire of the old
church. Observing the purpose of the negro,
Mr. Cozart smiled cynically and flipped
the hot ashes of his cigar into Balaam’s ear.</p>

<p>“As you are telling the town good-by,”
said the young man, “I’ll help you to bow.”</p>

<p>“Yasser!” said Balaam, shaking the ashes
from his ear; “I was des a-lookin’ back
at de place. Dat sun shine red, mon, an’
de jail look like she de bigges’ house dar.
She stan’ out mo’ bigger dan w’at de chu’ch
do.”</p>

<p>It may be that this statement made no
impression on Berrien, but he leaned back
in his seat and for miles chewed the end of
his cigar in silence.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of this chronicle to
follow him through all his adventures and
escapades. As he rode away from Billville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
on that memorable day he seemed to realize
that his career had just begun. It was a
career to which he had served a long and
faithful apprenticeship, and he pursued it to
the end. From Madison he went to Atlanta,
where for months he was a familiar,
albeit a striking figure. There were few
games of chance in which he was not an
adept. No conjurer was so adroit with the
cards or the dice; he handled these emblems
of fate and disaster as an artist handles his
tools. And luck chose him as her favorite;
he prospered to such a degree that he grew
reckless and careless. Whereupon one fine
day luck turned her back on him, and he
paraded on fine afternoons in front of Lloyd’s
Hotel a penniless man. He had borrowed
and lost until he could borrow no longer.</p>

<p>Balaam, who was familiar with the situation,
was not surprised to learn that his
master had made up his mind to sell him.</p>

<p>“Well, suh,” said Balaam, brushing his
master’s coat carefully,“you kin sell me,
but de man dat buys Balaam will git a
mighty bad bargain.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” exclaimed Berrien.</p>

<p>“You kin sell me, suh, but I ain’t gwine
stay wid um.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>“You can’t help yourself,” said the master.</p>

<p>“I got legs, Marse Berry. You know
dat yo’se’f.”</p>

<p>“Your legs will do you no good. You’ll
be caught if you go back home.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t gwine dar, suh. I’m gwine wid
you. I hear you say yistiddy night p’intedly
dat you gwine ’way f’om dis place, an’ I’m
gwine wid you. I been ’long wid you all
de time, an’ ole marster done tole me w’en
you was baby dat I got ter stay wid you.”</p>

<p>Something in this view seemed to strike
Mr. Cozart. He walked up and down the
floor a few minutes, and then fell to laughing.</p>

<p>“By George, Balaam, you are a trump,—a
royal flush in spades. It will be a famous
joke.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Berrien Cozart arranged his
cards, so to speak, for a more hazardous
game than any he had ever yet played. He
went with Balaam to a trader who was an
expert in the slave market, and who knew
its ups and downs, its weak points and its
strong points. At first Berrien was disposed
to put Balaam on the block and have
him auctioned off to the highest bidder; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the trader knew the negro, and had already
made a study of his strong points. To be
perfectly sure, however, he thumped Balaam
on the chest, listened to the beating of his
heart, and felt of his muscles in quite a professional
way.</p>

<p>“I reckon he ain’t noways vicious,” said
the trader, looking at Balaam’s smiling face.</p>

<p>“I have never seen him angry or sullen,”
said Mr. Cozart. Other questions were
asked, and finally the trader jotted down this
memorandum in his note-book:—</p>

<p>“Buck nigger, Balaam; age 32; 6 feet
1 inch; sound as a dollar; see Colonel
Strother.”</p>

<p>Then the trader made an appointment
with Berrien for the next day, and said he
thought the negro could be disposed off at
private sale. Such was the fact, for when
Berrien went back the next day the trader
met him with an offer of fifteen hundred
dollars in cash for Balaam.</p>

<p>“Make it eighteen,” said Mr. Cozart.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” said
the trader, closing his eyes and pursing his
mouth in a business-like way. “I’ll give
you sixteen fifty—no more, no less. Come,
now, that’s fair. Split the difference.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon Mr. Cozart said it was a bargain,
and the trader paid him the money
down after the necessary papers were drawn
up. Balaam seemed to be perfectly satisfied.
All he wanted, he said, was to have a master
who would treat him well. He went
with Berrien to the hotel to fetch his little
belongings, and if the trader had searched
him when he returned he would have found
strapped around his body a belt containing
fifty dollars in specie.</p>

<p>Having thus, in a manner, replenished his
empty purse, Mr. Berrien Cozart made haste
to change his field of operations. To his
competitors in his own special department
of industry he let drop the hint that he was
going to Columbus, and thence to Mobile
and New Orleans, where he would hang on
the outskirts of the racing season, picking
up such crumbs and contributions as might
naturally fall in the way of a professional
gentleman who kept his eyes open and his
fingers nimble enough to deal himself a winning
hand.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact Mr. Cozart went to
Nashville, and he had not been gone many
days before Balaam disappeared. He had
been missing two days before Colonel Strother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
his new master, took any decided action,
but on the morning of the fourth day
the following advertisement appeared among
others of a like character in the columns of
the Atlanta “Intelligencer”:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/balaam.jpg" width="75" height="115" alt="A drawing of Balaam" />
</div>

<p>$100 reward will be paid for the
apprehension of my negro boy <em>Balaam</em>.
Thirty-odd years old, but appeared
younger; tall, pleasant-looking,
quick-spoken, and polite. Was formerly
the property of the Hon. William
Cozart. He is supposed to be making his
way to his old home. Was well dressed when
last seen. Milledgeville “Recorder” and “Federal
Union” please copy.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bozeman Strother</span>,<br />
Atlanta, Georgia.</p>

<p class="smaller">(d. &amp; w. 1 mo.)</p>

</div>

<p>This advertisement duly appeared in the
Milledgeville papers, which were published
not far from Billville, but no response was
ever made; the reward was never claimed.
Considering the strength and completeness
of the patrol system of that day, Balaam’s
adventure was a risky one; but, fortunately
for him, a wiser head than his had planned
his flight and instructed him thoroughly in
the part he was to play. The shrewdness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Berrien Cozart had provided against all
difficulties. Balaam left Atlanta at night,
but he did not go as a fugitive. He was
armed with a “pass” which formally set
forth to all to whom it might concern that
the boy David had express permission to
join his master in Nashville, and this “pass”
bore the signature of Elmore Avery, a gentleman
who existed only in the imagination
of Mr. Berrien Cozart. Attached thereto,
also, was the signature seal of the judge of
ordinary. With this little document Balaam
would have found no difficulty whatever
in traveling. The people he met would have
reasoned that the negro whose master trusted
him to make so long a journey alone must
be an uncommonly faithful one, but Balaam
met with an adventure that helped him
along much more comfortably than the pass
could have helped him. It is best, perhaps,
to tell the story in his own language, as he
told it long afterwards.</p>

<p>“I won’t say I weren’t skeered,” said Balaam,
“kaze I was; yit I weren’t skeered
’nough fer ter go slippin’ ’longside er de
fences an’ ’mongst de pine thickets. I des
kep’ right in de big road. Atter I got out
er town a little piece, I tuck off my shoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
an’ tied de strings tergedder an’ slung ’em
’cross my shoulder, on top my satchel, an’
den I sorter mended my gait. I struck up
a kind er dog-trot, an’ by de time day come
a many a mile lay ’twix’ me an’ Atlanta.
Little atter sun-up I hear some horses trottin’
on de road de way I come, an’ bimeby a
man driv up in a double buggy. He say,
‘Hello, boy! Whar you gwine?’ I pulled
off my hat, an’ say, ‘I gwine whar my marster
is, suh.’ Den de white man ’low,
‘W’at he name?’ Well, suh, when de man
ax me dat, hit come over me like a big
streak er de chill an’ fever dat I done clean
fergit de name what Marse Berry choosen
ter be call by. So I des runned my han’
und’ de lindin’ er my hat an’ pulled out de
pass, an’ say, ‘Boss, dis piece er paper kin
talk lots better dan I kin.’</p>

<p>“De man look at me right hard, an’ den
he tuck de pass an’ read it out loud. Well,
suh, w’en he come ter de name I des grabbed
holt un it wid my min’, an’ I ain’t never
turned it loose tell yit. De man was drivin’
long slow, an’ I was walkin’ by de buggy.
He helt de pass in his han’s some little time,
den he look at me an’ scratch his head. Atter
a while he ’low: ‘You got a mighty long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
journey befo’ you. Kin you drive? Ef you
kin, put on yo’ shoes an’ mount up here an’
take dese lines.’</p>

<p>“Well, suh, I wuz sorter glad, an’ yit I
wuz sorter skittish, but I tol’ de white man
thankydo, an’ le’pt up in dat buggy like I
was de gladdes’ nigger in de worl’. De man
he keep on lookin’ at me, an’ bimeby he
say, ‘I tuck a notion when I fust see you
dat you was de boy w’at Cozart had in Atlanta.’
Mon! you could er knocked me
over wid a feather, I was dat weak; but I
bu’st out laughin’ an’ ’low, ‘Lord, boss! ef I
wa’n’t no better lookin’ dan dat ar Cozart
nigger I’d quit bein’ a nigger an’ take up
wid de monkey tribe.’ De man say, ‘I had
de idee dat de Cozart nigger was a mighty
likely boy. What was his name? Balaam?’
I was so skeered it fair make me sick at de
stomach, yit I talk right out. I ’low,
‘Dey call ’im Balaam, an’ dey have ter
whale ’im.’ De man he laugh, ‘He got a
great big scyar on de side er his neck now
whar somebody hit ’im a diff, an’ he lay
roun’ dem hotels an’ drink dram all night
long.’ De man look sideways at my neck.
‘Dat nigger got so bad dat his marster had
ter sell ’im, an’ dey tells me, suh, dat de man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
w’at buy ’im ain’ no mo’ dan paid de money
fer ’im dan he have ter take ’im down and
strop ’im.’</p>

<p>“Well, suh, de man look at me an laugh
so funny dat it make my ve’y limbs ache.
Yes, suh. My heart hit up ’g’inst my ribs
des like a flutter-mill; an’ I wuz so skeered
it make my tongue run slicker dan sin. He
ax me mo’ questions dan I could answer now,
but I made answer den des like snappin’ my
fingers. W’at make me de mo’ skeered was
de way dat ar white man done. He’d look
at me an’ laugh, an’ de plumper I gin ’im de
answer de mo’ he’d laugh. I say ter myse’f,
I did: ‘Balaam, you’r’ a goner, dat
w’at you is. De man know you, an’ de fust
calaboose he come ter he gwine slap you in
dar.’ I had a mighty good notion ter jump
out er dat buggy an’ make a break fer de
woods, but stidder dat I sot right whar I
wuz, kaze I knowed in reason dat ef de man
want me right bad an’ I wuz ter break an’
run he’d fetch me down wid a pistol.</p>

<p>“Well, suh, dat man joke an’ laugh de
whole blessed mornin,’ an’ den bimeby we
drove in a town not much bigger dan Bivvle”
(which was Balaam’s pet name for
Billville), “an’ dar de white man say we’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
stop fer dinner. He ain’t say de word too
soon fer me, mon, kaze I was so hongry an’
tired it make my head swim. We driv up
ter tavern, we did, an’ de folks dar dey holler,
‘Howdy, Judge,’ an’ de white man he
holler ‘Howdy’ back, an’ den he tol’ me
ter take de horses an’ buggy down ter de
liberty stable an’ have ’em fed, an’ den
come back an’ git my dinner. Dat wuz
mighty good news; but whilst I wuz eatin’
my dinner I hear dat white man laughin’,
an’ it come over me dat he know who I wuz
an’ dat he wuz gwine ter gi’ me up; yit dat
ain’t hender my appetite, an’ I des sot dar
an’ stuff myse’f tell I des make de yuther
niggers open der eyes. An’ den, when I
git my belly full, I sot in de sun an’ went
right fast ter sleep. I ’spec’ I tuck a right
smart nap, kaze when some un hollered at
me an’ woke me up de sun wuz gwine down
de hill right smartly. I jumped up on my
feet, I did, an’ I say, ‘Who dat callin’ me?’
Somebody ’low, ‘Yo’ marster want you.’
Den I bawl out, ‘Is Marse Berry come?’
De niggers all laugh, an’ one un ’em say,
‘Dat nigger man dreamin’, mon. He ain’t
woke good yit.’</p>

<p>“By dat time I done come ter my senses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
an’ den I ax dem wharbouts marster is.
Bimeby, when I done foun’ de white man
w’at bring me in his buggy, he look at me
sorter funny an’ say, ‘You know whar you
lef’ my buggy: well, you go down an’ raise
up de seat an’ fetch me de little box you’ll
fin’ in dar. Wrop it up in de buggy rug
an’ fetch it an’ put it on de table dar.’ Well,
suh, I went an’ got dat box, an’ time I put
my han’ on it I knowed des ’zactly w’at wuz
on de inside er it. I done seed too many
er ’em. It wuz under lock an’ key, but I
knowed it wuz a farrar box like dem w’at
Marse Berry done his gamblin’ wid. By de
time I got back ter de room in de tavern de
white man done had de table kivered wid a
piece er cloff w’at he got out ’n his satchel.
He tuck de box, onlocked it, rattled de chips
in his han’, an’ shuffled de kyards. Den he
look at me an’ laugh. He was de quarest
white man dat ever I laid eyes on.</p>

<p>“Atter while I ax ’im ef I hadn’t better
be gitten’ ’long todes de eend er my journey.
He ’low: ‘Lord, no! I want you ter set
round yere atter supper an’ gi’ me luck.
You ain’t losin’ no time, kaze I’m a-gwine
plumb to Chattanoogy, an’ ef you’ll be ez
spry ez you kin be I’ll take you ’long wid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
me.’ De ups an’ odds er it was dat I stayed
wid de man. De folks named ’im Judge, an’
he was a judge, mon. ’Long ’bout nine dat
night he come ter his room, whar I was waitin’
fer ’im, an’ soon atter dat de young gentlemens
’bout town ’gun ter drap in, an’
’t wa’n’t long ’fo’ de game got started.
Look like de man ain’t wanter play, but de
yuthers dey kep’ on coaxin’, an’ presently
he fotch out de box an’ opened up. Well,
sah, I done seed lots er gamblin’ fust an’
last, but dat white man beat my time. Dey
played poker, stidder farrar, an’ it look like
ter me dat de man done got de kyards
trained. He dealt ’em ’boveboard, an’ dey
des come in his han’ ’zackly like he want ’em
ter come. Ef he had any tricks like w’at
Marse Berry played on folks, dey was too
slick fer my eye, yit he des beated dem
yuther mens scand’lous. It was des like one
er dese yere great big river cats ketchin’
minners.</p>

<p>“Atter dey been playin’ some little time, de
white man what brung me dar ’low: ‘Boy,
you better go git some sleep. We’ll start
soon in de mornin’.’ But I say, ‘No, suh;
I’ll des set in de cornder here an’ nod, an’
I’ll be close by ef so be you want me.’ I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
sot dar, I did, an’ I had a good chance ter
sleep, kaze, bless yo’ heart! dem mens ain’t
make much fuss. Dey des grip der kyards
an’ sorter hol’ der bref. Sometimes one
un ’em would break out an’ cuss a word er
two, but inginer’lly dey ’d plank up der
scads an’ lose ’em des like dey wuz usen ter
it. De white man w’at dey call Judge he
des wiped ’em up, an’ at de een’ he wuz des
ez fresh ez he wuz at de start. It wuz so
nigh day when de game broke up dat Marse
Judge ’lowed dat it was too late fer supper
an’ not quite soon ’nough fer breakfas’, an’
den he say he wuz gwine ter take a walk
an’ git some a’r.</p>

<p>“Well, suh, it wuz dat away all de time I
wuz wid dat white man—laughin’ an’ jokin’
all day, an’ gamblin’ all night long. How
an’ when he got sleep I’ll never tell you,
kaze he wuz wide awake eve’y time I seed
’im. It went on dis away plumb till we got
ter de Tennessy River, dar whar Chattynoogy
is. Atter we sorter rested, de white
man tuck me ’cross de river, an’ we druv on
ter whar de stage changes hosses. Dar we
stopped, an’ whilst I wuz waitin’ fer de
stage de white man ’low, ‘Balaam!’ He
kotch me so quick, dat I jump des like I’d<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
been shot, an’ hollered out, ‘Suh!’ Den
he laugh sorter funny, an’ say: ‘Don’t look
skeered, Balaam; I knowed you fum de offstart.
You’r’ a mighty good boy, but yo’
marster is a borned rascal. I’m gwine send
you whar you say he is, an’ I want you ter
tell ’im dis fum me—dat dough he tried
ter rob me, yit fer de sake er his Cousin
Sally, I he’ped you ter go whar he is.’</p>

<p>“Den de man got in his buggy an’ driv
back, an’ dat de las’ time I ever laid eyes
on ’im. When de stage come ’long I got
up wid de driver, an’ ’t wa’n’t long ’fo’ I
wuz wid Marse Berry, an’ I ain’t no sooner
seed ’im dan I knowed he was gwine wrong
wuss and wuss: not but w’at he was glad
kaze I come, but it look like his face done
got mo’ harder. Well, suh, it was des dat
away. I ain’t gwine ter tell you all w’at he
done an’ how he done it, kaze he was my
own marster, an’ he never hit me a lick
amiss, ’ceppin’ it was when he was a little
boy. I ain’t gwine ter tell you whar we
went an’ how we got dar, kaze dey done
been too much talk now. But we drapped
down inter Alabam’, an’ den inter Massasip’,
an’ den inter Arkansaw, an’ back ag’in
inter Massasip’; an’ one night whilst we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
wuz on one er dem big river boats, Marse
Berry he got inter a mighty big row. Dey
wuz playin’ kyards fer de bigges’ kind er
stakes, an’ fust news I know de lie was
passed, an’ den de whole gang made fer
Marse Berry. Dey whipped out der knives
an’ der pistols, an’ it look like it wuz gwine
ter be all night wid Marse Berry. Well, suh,
I got so skeered dat I picked up a cheer an’
smashed de nighest man, and by dat time
Marse Berry had shot one; an’, suh, we des
cleaned ’em out. Den Marse Berry made a
dash fer de low’-mos’ deck, an’ I dashed atter
’im. Den I hear sumpin’ go ker-slosh
in de water, an’ I ’lowed it was Marse Berry,
an’ in I splunged head-foremos’. An’ den—but,
Lord, suh, you know de balance des
good ez I does, kaze I hear tell dat dey wuz
sumpin’ n’er ’bout it in de papers.”</p>

<p>This was as far as Balaam ever would go
with the story of his adventure. He had
made a hero of Berrien Cozart from his
youth, and he refused to dwell on any episode
in the young man’s career that, to his
mind, was not worthy of a Cozart. When
Berrien leaped to the lower deck of the
steamboat his foot touched a stick of wood.
This he flung into the river, and then hid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
himself among the cotton bales that were
piled on the forward part of the boat. It
will never be known whether he threw the
piece of wood into the water knowing that
Balaam would follow, or whether his sole
intention was to elude pursuit. A shot or
two was fired, but the bullets fell wide of
their mark, and the boat swept on, leaving
the negro swimming around, searching for
his master.</p>

<p>At the next landing-place Berrien slipped
ashore unseen. But fortune no longer favored
him; for the next day a gentleman
who had been a passenger on the boat recognized
him, and an attempt was made to arrest
him. He shot the high sheriff of the
county through the head, and became a fugitive
indeed. He was pursued through Alabama
into Georgia, and being finally captured
not a mile away from Billville, was
thrown into jail in the town where he was
born. His arrest, owing to the standing of
his family, created a tremendous sensation
in the quiet village. Before he was carried
to jail he asked that his father be sent for.
The messenger tarried some little time, but
he returned alone.</p>

<p>“What did my father say?” Berrien
asked with some eagerness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“He said,” replied the messenger, “that
he didn’t want to see you.”</p>

<p>“Did he write that message?” the young
man inquired.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” the messenger declared. “He
just waved his arm—so—and said he didn’t
want to see you.”</p>

<p>At once the troubled expression on Berrien
Cozart’s face disappeared. He looked
around on the crowd and smiled.</p>

<p>“You see what it is,” he said with a light
laugh, “to be the pride of a family! Gentlemen,
I am ready. Don’t let me keep you
waiting.” And so, followed by half the
population of his native village, he was escorted
to jail.</p>

<p>This building was a two-story brick structure,
as solid as good material and good
work could make it, and there was no fear
that any prisoner could escape, especially
from the dungeon where Berrien’s captors
insisted on confining him. Nevertheless
the jailer was warned to take unusual precautions.
This official, however, who occupied
with his family the first story of the
jail, merely smiled. He had grown old in
the business of keeping this jail, and certainly
he knew a great deal more about it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
than those Mississippi officials who were
strutting around and putting on such airs.</p>

<p>To his other duties the jailer added those
of tyler of the little lodge of freemasons
that had its headquarters in a hall on the
public square, and it so happened that the
lodge was to meet on the very night that
Berrien was put into jail. After supper the
jailer, as had been his habit for years,
smoked his pipe, and then went down to the
village and lighted the lamps in the masonic
hall. His wife and daughter, full of
the subject of Berrien Cozart’s imprisonment,
went to a neighbor’s not far away for
the purpose of discussing the matter. As
they passed out of the gate they heard the
jailer blowing the tin trumpet which was the
signal for the masons to assemble.</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven o’clock when the
jailer returned, but he found his wife and
daughter waiting for him. Both had a
troubled air, and they lost no time in declaring
that they had heard weeping and sobbing
upstairs in the dungeon. The jailer
himself was very sympathetic, having known
Berrien for many years, and he took another
turn at his pipe by way of consolation.
Then, as was his custom, he took his lantern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and went around the jail on a tour of inspection
to see that everything was safe.</p>

<p>He did not go far. First he stumbled
over a pile of bricks, and then his shoulder
struck a ladder. He uttered a little cry and
looked upward, and there, dim as his lantern
was, he could see a black and gaping
hole in the wall of the dungeon. He ran
into the house as fast as his rheumatic legs
could carry him, and he screamed to his wife
and daughter:—</p>

<p>“Raise the alarm! Cozart has escaped!
We are ruined!”</p>

<p>Then he ran to the dungeon door, flung
it open, and then fell back with a cry of
terror. What did he see, and what did the
others who joined him there see? On the
floor lay Berrien Cozart dead, and crouching
beside him was Balaam. How the negro
had managed to make his way through
the masonry of the dungeon without discovery
is still one of the mysteries of Billville.
But, prompt as he was, he was too
late. His master had escaped through a
wider door. He had made his way to a
higher court. Death, coming to him in that
dark dungeon, must have visited him in
the similitude of a happy dream, for there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
under the light of the lanterns he lay smiling
sweetly as a little child that nestles on
its mother’s breast; and on the floor near
him, where it had dropped from his nerveless
hand, was a golden locket, from which
smiled the lovely face of Sally Carter.</p>

<h2 id="A_CONSCRIPTS_CHRISTMAS">A CONSCRIPT’S CHRISTMAS.</h2>

<p>On a Sunday afternoon in December,
1863, two horsemen were making their way
across Big Corn Valley in the direction of
Sugar Mountain. They had started from
the little town of Jasper early in the morning,
and it was apparent at a glance that
they had not enjoyed the journey. They
sat listlessly in their saddles, with their carbines
across their laps, and whatever conversation
they carried on was desultory.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, the journey from Jasper
to the top of Sugar Mountain was not a
pleasant one even in the best of weather,
and now, with the wind pushing before it a
bitterly cold mist, its disagreeableness was
irritating. And it was not by any means a
short journey. Big Corn Valley was fifteen
miles across as the crow flies, and the meanderings
of the road added five more. Then
there was the barrier of the foothills, and
finally Sugar Mountain itself, which when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the weather was clear lifted itself above all
the other mountains of that region.</p>

<p>Nor was this all. Occasionally, when the
wind blew aside the oilskin overcoats of the
riders, the gray uniform of the Confederacy
showed beneath, and they wore cavalry
boots, and there were tell-tale trimmings on
their felt hats. With these accoutrements
to advertise them, they were not in a
friendly region. There were bushwhackers
in the mountains, and, for aught the horsemen
knew, the fodder stacks in the valley,
that rose like huge and ominous ghosts out
of the mist on every side, might conceal
dozens of guerrillas. They had that day
ridden past the house of the only member of
the Georgia State convention who had refused
to affix his signature to the ordinance
of secession, and the woods, to use the provincial
phrase, were full of Union men.</p>

<p>Suddenly, and with a fierce and ripping
oath, one of the horsemen drew rein. “I
wish I may die,” he exclaimed, his voice
trembling with long pent up irritation, “if
I ain’t a great mind to turn around in my
tracks an’ go back. Where does this cussed
road lead to anyhow?”</p>

<p>“To the mountain—straight to the mountain,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
grimly remarked the other, who had
stopped to see what was the matter with his
companion.</p>

<p>“Great Jerusalem! straight? Do you
see that fodder stack yonder with the hawk
on the top of the pole? Well, we’ve passed
it four times, and we ain’t no further away
from it now than we was at fust.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve no time to stand here. In
an hour we’ll be at the foot of the mountain,
and a quarter of a mile further we’ll
find shelter. We must attend to business
and talk it over afterwards.”</p>

<p>“An’ it’s a mighty nice business, too,”
said the man who had first spoken. He was
slender in build, and his thin and straggling
mustache failed to relieve his effeminate appearance.
He had evidently never seen
hard service. “I never have believed in this
conscriptin’ business,” he went on in a complaining
tone. “It won’t pan out. It has
turned more men agin the Confederacy than
it has turned fer it, or else my daddy’s name
ain’t Bill Chadwick, nor mine neither.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the other curtly, “it’s the
law, Bill Chadwick, and it must be carried
out. We’ve got our orders.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! You are the commander,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Cap’n Moseley, an’ I’m the army. Ain’t I
the gayest army you ever had under you?
I’ll tell you what, Cap’n Moseley (I’d call
you Dick, like I useter, if we wasn’t in the
ranks), when I j’ined the army I thought
I was goin’ to fight the Yankees, but they
slapped me in the camp of instruction over
there at Adairsville, an’ now here we are
fightin’ our own folks. If we ain’t fightin’
’em, we are pursuin’ after ’em, an’ runnin’
’em into the woods an’ up the mountains.
Now what kind of a soldier will one of these
conscripts make? You needn’t tell me,
Cap’n! The law won’t pan out.”</p>

<p>“But it’s the law,” said Captain Moseley.
The captain had been wounded in Virginia,
and was entitled to a discharge, but he accepted
the position of conscript officer. He
had the grit and discipline of a veteran, and
a persistence in carrying out his purposes
that gave him the name of “Hardhead” in
the army. He was tall and muscular, but
his drooping left shoulder showed where a
Federal bullet had found lodgment. His
closely cropped beard was slightly streaked
with gray, and his face would have been
handsome had not determination left its rude
handwriting there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The two rode on together in silence a little
space, the cold mists, driven by the wind,
tingling in their faces. Presently Private
Chadwick, who had evidently been ruminating
over the matter, resumed the thread of
his complaints.</p>

<p>“They tell me,” he said, “that it’s a
heap easier to make a bad law than it is to
make a good one. It takes a lot of smart
men a long time to make a good one, but a
passel of blunderbusses can patch a bad one
up in a little or no time. That’s the way I
look at it.</p>

<p>“What’s the name of this chap we are
after? Israel Spurlock? I’d like to know,
by George, what’s the matter with him!
What makes him so plague-taked important
that two men have to be sent on a wild-goose
chase after him? They yerked him
into army, an’ he yerked himself out, an’
now the word is that the war can’t go on
unless Israel Spurlock is on hand to fling
down his gun an’ run when he hears a bung-shell
playin’ a tune in the air.”</p>

<p>Captain Moseley coughed to hide a smile.</p>

<p>“It’s jest like I tell you, Cap’n. The
news is that we had a terrible victory at
Chattanooga, but I notice in the Atlanta papers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that the Yankees ain’t no further north
than they was before the fight; an’ what
makes it wuss, they are warmin’ themselves
in Chattanooga, whilst we are shiverin’ outside.
I reckon if Israel Spurlock had been
on hand at the right time an’ in the right
place, we’d a drove the Yanks plumb back
to Nashville. Lord! I hope we’ll have him
on the skirmish line the next time we surround
the enemy an’ drive him into a town
as big as Chattanooga.”</p>

<p>Private Chadwick kept up his complaints
for some time, but they failed to disturb the
serenity of the captain, who urged his horse
forward through the mist, closely followed
by his companion. They finally left the
valley, passed over the foothills, and began
the ascent of Sugar Mountain. Here their
journey became less disagreeable. The road,
winding and twisting around the mountain,
had been cut through a dense growth of
trees, and these proved to be something of
a shelter. Moreover, the road sometimes
brought the mountain between the travelers
and the wind, and these were such comfortable
intervals that Mr. Chadwick ceased his
complaints and rode along good-humoredly.</p>

<p>The two horsemen had gone about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
mile, measuring the mountain road, though
they were not more than a quarter of a
mile from the foot, when they came suddenly
on an old man sitting in a sheltered
place by the side of the road. They came
on the stranger so suddenly that their horses
betrayed alarm, and it was all they could
do to keep the animals from slipping and
rolling into the gorge at their left. The
old man was dressed in a suit of gray jeans,
and wore a wool hat, which, although it
showed the signs of constant use, had somehow
managed to retain its original shape.
His head was large and covered with a profusion
of iron-gray hair, which was neatly
combed. His face was round, but the lines
of character obliterated all suggestions of
chubbiness. The full beard that he wore
failed to hide evidences of firmness and determination;
but around his mouth a serene
smile lingered, and humor sparkled in his
small brown eyes.</p>

<p>“Howdy, boys, howdy!” he exclaimed.
“Tired as they look to be, you er straddlin’
right peart creeturs. A flirt or two more
an’ they’d ’a’ flung you down the hill, an’
’a’ follered along atter you, headstall an’
stirrup. They done like they weren’t expectin’
company in an’ around here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The sonorous voice and deliberate utterance
of the old man bespoke his calling.
He was evidently a minister of the gospel.
This gave a clew to Captain Moseley’s
memory.</p>

<p>“This must be Uncle Billy Powers,” said
the captain. “I have heard you preach
many a time when I was a boy.”</p>

<p>“That’s my name,” said Uncle Billy;
“an’ in my feeble way I’ve been a-preachin’
the Word as it was given to me forty
year, lackin’ one. Ef I ever saw you, the
circumstance has slipped from me.”</p>

<p>“My name is Moseley,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“I useter know Jeremiah Moseley in my
younger days,” said Uncle Billy, gazing reflectively
at the piece of pine bark he was
whittling. “Yes, yes! I knowed Brother
Moseley well. He was a God-fearin’ man.”</p>

<p>“He was my father,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well!” exclaimed Uncle
Billy, in a tone that seemed to combine reflection
with astonishment. “Jerry Moseley’s
son; I disremember the day when
Brother Moseley came into my mind, an’ yit,
now that I hear his name bandied about up
here on the hill, it carries me back to ole
times. He weren’t much of a preacher on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
his own hook, but let ’im foller along for to
clench the sermon, an’ his match couldn’t
be foun’ in them days. Yit, Jerry was a
man of peace, an’ here’s his son a-gwine
about with guns an’ pistols, an’ what not,
a-tryin’ to give peaceable folks a smell of
war.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said Captain Moseley, laughing;
“we are just hunting up some old acquaintances,—some
friends of ours that
we’d like to see.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Uncle Billy, sinking his
knife deep into the soft pine bark, “it’s bad
weather for a frolic, an’ it ain’t much better
for a straight-out, eve’y-day call. Speshually
up here on the hill, where the ground
is so wet and slipperyfied. It looks like
you’ve come a mighty long ways for to pay
a friendly call. An’ yit,” the old man continued,
looking up at the captain with a
smile that well became his patriarchal face,
“thar ain’t a cabin on the hill whar you
won’t be more than welcome. Yes, sir;
wheresomever you find a h’a’thstone, thar
you’ll find a place to rest.”</p>

<p>“So I have heard,” said the captain.
“But maybe you can cut our journey short.
We have a message for Israel Spurlock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Immediately Captain Moseley knew that
the placid and kindly face of Uncle Billy
Powers had led him into making a mistake.
He knew that he had mentioned Israel Spurlock’s
name to the wrong man at the wrong
time. There was a scarcely perceptible
frown on Uncle Billy’s face as he raised it
from his piece of pine bark, which was now
assuming the shape of a horseman’s pistol,
and he looked at the captain through half-closed
eyelids.</p>

<p>“Come, now,” he exclaimed, “ain’t Israel
Spurlock in the war? Didn’t a posse
ketch ’im down yander in Jasper an’ take an’
cornscrip’ ’im into the army? Run it over
in your mind now! Ain’t Israel Spurlock
crippled some’r’s, an’ ain’t your message for
his poor ole mammy?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said the captain, laughing, and
trying to hide his inward irritation.</p>

<p>“Not so?” exclaimed Uncle Billy.
“Well, sir, you must be shore an’ set me
right when I go wrong; but I’ll tell you
right pine blank, I’ve had Israel Spurlock
in my min’ off an’ on’ ev’ry since they run
him down an’ kotch him an’ drug ’im off to
war. He was weakly like from the time he
was a boy, an’ when I heard you call forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
his name, I allowed to myself, says I, ‘Israel
Spurlock is sick, an’ they’ve come atter
his ole mammy to go an’ nuss him.’ That’s
the idee that riz up in my min’.”</p>

<p>A man more shrewd than Captain Moseley
would have been deceived by the bland
simplicity of Uncle Billy’s tone.</p>

<p>“No,” said he; “Spurlock is not sick.
He is a sounder man than I am. He was
conscripted in Jasper and carried to Adairsville,
and after he got used to the camp he
concluded that he would come home and tell
his folks good-by.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s jes like Israel,” said Uncle
Billy, closing his eyes and compressing his
lips—“jes like him for the world. He
knowed that he was drug off right spang at
the time he wanted to be getherin’ in his
craps, an’ savin’ his ruffage, an’ one thing
an’ another bekaze his ole mammy didn’t
have a soul to help her but ’im. I reckon
he’s been a-housin’ his corn an’ sich like.
The ole ’oman tuck on might’ly when Israel
was snatched into the army.”</p>

<p>“How far is it to shelter?” inquired
Captain Moseley.</p>

<p>“Not so mighty fur,” responded Uncle
Billy, whittling the pine bark more cautiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
“Jes keep in the middle of the
road an’ you’ll soon come to it. Ef I ain’t
thar before you, jes holler for Aunt Crissy
an’ tell her that you saw Uncle Billy some’r’s
in the woods an’ he told you to wait for ’im.”</p>

<p>With that, Captain Moseley and Private
Chadwick spurred their horses up the mountain
road, leaving Uncle Billy whittling.</p>

<p>“Well, dang my buttons!” exclaimed
Chadwick, when they were out of hearing.</p>

<p>“What now?” asked the captain, turning
in his saddle. Private Chadwick had
stopped his horse and was looking back down
the mountain as if he expected to be pursued.</p>

<p>“I wish I may die,” he went on, giving
his horse the rein, “if we ain’t walked right
square into it with our eyes wide open.”</p>

<p>“Into what?” asked the captain, curtly.</p>

<p>“Into trouble,” said Chadwick. “Oh,”
he exclaimed, looking at his companion
seriously, “you may grin behind your beard,
but you just wait till the fun begins—all
the grins you can muster will be mighty dry
grins. Why, Cap., I could read that old
chap as if he was a newspaper. Whilst he
was a-watchin’ you I was a-watchin’ him, an’
if he ain’t got a war map printed on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
face I ain’t never saw none in the ‘Charleston
Mercury.’”</p>

<p>“The old man is a preacher,” said Captain
Moseley in a tone that seemed to dispose
of the matter.</p>

<p>“Well, the Lord help us!” exclaimed
Chadwick. “In about the wuss whippin’ I
ever got was from a young feller that was
preachin’ an’ courtin’ in my neighborhood.
I sorter sassed him about a gal he was flyin’
around, an’ he upped an’ frailed me out, an’
got the gal to boot. Don’t tell me about no
preachers. Why, that chap flew at me like
a Stonefence rooster, an’ he fluttered twice
to my once.”</p>

<p>“And have you been running from preachers
ever since?” dryly inquired the captain.</p>

<p>“Not as you may say, constantly a-runnin’,”
replied Chadwick; “yit I ain’t been
a-flingin’ no sass at ’em; an’ my reason tells
me for to give ’em the whole wedth of the
big road when I meet ’em.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the captain, “what will you
do about this preacher?”</p>

<p>“A man in a corner,” responded Chadwick,
“is obleeged to do the best he kin.
I’ll jest keep my eye on him, an’ the fust
motion he makes, I’ll”—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>“Run?” suggested the captain.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” said Chadwick, “a man in
a corner can’t most ingener’lly run. Git
me hemmed in, an’ I’ll scratch an’ bite an’
scuffle the best way I know how. It’s human
natur’, an’ I’m mighty glad it is; for
if that old man’s eyes didn’t tell no lies we’ll
have to scratch an’ scuffle before we git
away from this mountain.”</p>

<p>Captain Moseley bit his mustache and
smiled grimly as the tired horses toiled up
the road. A vague idea of possible danger
had crossed his mind while talking to Uncle
Billy Powers, but he dismissed it at once as a
matter of little importance to a soldier bent
on carrying out his orders at all hazards.</p>

<p>It was not long before the two travelers
found themselves on a plateau formed by a
shoulder of the mountain. On this plateau
were abundant signs of life. Cattle were
grazing about among the trees, chickens
were crowing, and in the distance could be
heard the sound of a woman’s voice singing.
As they pressed forward along the level road
they came in sight of a cabin, and the blue
smoke curling from its short chimney was
suggestive of hospitality. It was a comfortable-looking
cabin, too, flanked by several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
outhouses. The buildings, in contrast with
the majestic bulk of the mountain, that still
rose precipitously skyward, were curiously
small, but there was an air of more than ordinary
neatness and coziness about them.
And there were touches of feminine hands
here and there that made an impression—rows
of well-kept boxwood winding like a
green serpent through the yard, and a privet
hedge that gave promise of rare sweetness
in the spring.</p>

<p>As the soldiers approached, a dog barked,
and then the singing ceased, and the figure
of a young girl appeared in the doorway,
only to disappear like a flash. This vision,
vanishing with incredible swiftness, was succeeded
by a more substantial one in the shape
of a motherly looking woman, who stood
gazing over her spectacles at the horsemen,
apparently undecided whether to frown or
to smile. The smile would have undoubtedly
forced its way to the pleasant face in any
event, for the years had fashioned many a
pathway for it, but just then Uncle Billy
Powers himself pushed the woman aside and
made his appearance, laughing.</p>

<p>“’Light, boys, ’light!” he exclaimed,
walking nimbly to the gate. “’Light whilst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
I off wi’ your creeturs’ gear. Ah!” he
went on, as he busied himself unsaddling
the horses, “you thought that while your
Uncle Billy was a-moonin’ aroun’ down the
hill yander you’d steal a march on your
Aunt Crissy, an’ maybe come a-conscriptin’
of her into the army. But not—not so!
Your Uncle Billy has been here long enough
to get his hands an’ his face rested.”</p>

<p>“You must have been in a tremendous
hurry,” said Captain Moseley, remembering
the weary length of mountain road he had
climbed.</p>

<p>“Why, I could ’a’ tuck a nap an’ ’a’ beat
you,” said the old man.</p>

<p>“Two miles of tough road, I should say,”
responded Moseley.</p>

<p>“Go straight through my hoss lot and
let yourself down by a saplin’ or two,” answered
Uncle Billy, “an’ it ain’t more ’n a
good quarter.” Whereupon the old man
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Jes leave the creeturs here,” he went
on. “John Jeems an’ Fillmore will ten’ to
’em whilst we go in an’ see what your Aunt
Crissy is gwine to give us for supper. You
won’t find the grub so mighty various, but
there is plenty enough of what they is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>There was just enough of deference in
Aunt Crissy’s greeting to be pleasing, and
her unfeigned manifestations of hospitality
soon caused the guests to forget that they
might possibly be regarded as intruders in
that peaceful region. Then there were the
two boys, John Jeems and Fillmore, both
large enough, and old enough, as Captain
Moseley quietly observed to himself, to do
military service, and both shy and awkward
to a degree. And then there was Polly, a
young woman grown, whose smiles all ran
to blushes and dimples. Though she was
grown, she had the ways of a girl—the vivacity
of health and good humor, and the
innocent shyness of a child of nature. Impulsive
and demure by turns, her moods
were whimsical and elusive and altogether
delightful. Her beauty, which illumined
the old cabin, was heightened by a certain
quality that may be described as individuality.
Her face and hands were browned
by the sun, but in her cheeks the roses of
youth and health played constantly. There
is nothing more charming to the eye of man
than the effects produced when modesty
parts company with mere formality and conventionality.
Polly, who was as shy as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
ground squirrel and as graceful, never pestered
herself about formalities. Innocence
is not infrequently a very delightful form of
boldness. It was so in the case of Polly
Powers, at any rate.</p>

<p>The two rough soldiers, unused to the society
of women, were far more awkward and
constrained than the young woman, but they
enjoyed the big fire and the comfortable supper
none the less on that account. When,
to employ Mrs. Powers’s vernacular, “the
things were put away,” they brought forth
their pipes; and they felt so contented that
Captain Moseley reproved himself by suggesting
that it might be well for them to
proceed on their journey up the mountain.
But their hosts refused to listen to such a
proposal.</p>

<p>“Not so,” exclaimed Uncle Billy; “by
no means. Why, if you knowed this hill
like we all, you’d hoot at the bar’ idee of
gwine further after nightfall. Besides,” the
old man went on, looking keenly at his
daughter, “ten to one you won’t find Spurlock.”</p>

<p>Polly had been playing with her hair,
which was caught in a single plait and tied
with a bit of scarlet ribbon. When Spurlock’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
name was mentioned she used the
plait as a whip, and struck herself impatiently
in the hand with the glossy black
thong, and then threw it behind her, where
it hung dangling nearly to the floor.</p>

<p>“Now I tell you what, boys,” said Uncle
Billy, after a little pause; “I’d jes like to
know who is at the bottom of this Spurlock
business. You all may have took a notion
that he’s a no-’count sorter chap—an’ he
is kinder puny; but what does the army
want with a puny man?”</p>

<p>“It’s the law,” said Captain Moseley,
simply, perceiving that his mission was
clearly understood. “He is old enough and
strong enough to serve in the army. The
law calls for him, and he’ll have to go.
The law wants him now worse than ever.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said private Chadwick, gazing
into the glowing embers—“lots worse’n
ever.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter along of him now?”
inquired Mrs. Powers, knocking the ashes
from her pipe against the chimney jamb.</p>

<p>“He’s a deserter,” said Chadwick.</p>

<p>“Tooby shore!” exclaimed Mrs. Powers.
“An’ what do they do wi’ ’em, then?”</p>

<p>For answer Private Chadwick passed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
right hand rapidly around his neck, caught
hold of an imaginary rope, and looked upwards
at the rafters, rolling his eyes and
distorting his features as though he were
strangling. It was a very effective pantomime.
Uncle Billy shook his head and
groaned, Aunt Crissy lifted her hands in
horror, and then both looked at Polly.
That young lady had risen from her chair
and made a step toward Chadwick. Her
eyes were blazing.</p>

<p>“You’ll be hung long before Israel Spurlock!”
she cried, her voice thick with anger.
Before another word had been said
she swept from the room, leaving Chadwick
sitting there with his mouth wide open.</p>

<p>“Don’t let Polly pester you,” said Uncle
Billy, smiling a little at Chadwick’s discomfiture.
“She thinks the world an’ all of
Sister Spurlock, an’ she’s been a-knowin’
Israel a mighty long time.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Aunt Crissy, with a sigh;
“the poor child is hot-headed an’ high-tempered.
I reckon we’ve sp’ilt ’er. ’T ain’t
hard to spile a gal when you hain’t got but
one.”</p>

<p>Before Chadwick could make reply a shrill,
querulous voice was heard coming from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
room into which Polly had gone. The girl
had evidently aroused some one who was
more than anxious to engage in a war of
words.</p>

<p>“Lord A’mighty massy! whar’s any
peace?” the shrill voice exclaimed. “What
chance on the top side of the yeth is a poor
sick creetur got? Oh, what makes you
come a-tromplin’ on the floor like a drove of
wild hosses, an’ a-shakin’ the clabberds on
the roof? I know! I know!”—the voice
here almost rose to a shriek,—“it’s ’cause
I’m sick an’ weak, an’ can’t he’p myself.
Lord! ef I but had strength!”</p>

<p>At this point Polly’s voice broke in, but
what she said could only be guessed by the
noise in the next room.</p>

<p>“Well, what ef the house an’ yard was
full of ’em? Who’s afeard? After Spurlock?
Who keers? Hain’t Spurlock got
no friends on Sugar Mountain? Ef they
are after Spurlock, ain’t Spurlock got as
good a right for to be after them? Oh, go
’way! Gals hain’t got no sense. Go ’way!
Go tell your pappy to come here an’ he’p
me in my cheer. Oh, go on!”</p>

<p>Polly had no need to go, however. Uncle
Billy rose promptly and went into the
next room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hit’s daddy,” said Aunt Crissy, by way
of explanation. “Lord! daddy used to be
a mighty man in his young days, but he’s
that wasted wi’ the palsy that he hain’t
more ’n a shadder of what he was. He’s
jes like a baby, an’ he’s mighty quar’lsome
when the win’ sets in from the east.”</p>

<p>According to all symptoms the wind was
at that moment setting terribly from the
east. There was a sound of shuffling in the
next room, and then Uncle Billy Powers
came into the room, bearing in his stalwart
arms a big rocking-chair containing a little
old man whose body and limbs were shriveled
and shrunken. Only his head, which
seemed to be abnormally large, had escaped
the ravages of whatever disease had seized
him. His eyes were bright as a bird’s and
his forehead was noble in its proportions.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” said Uncle Billy, “this
here is Colonel Dick Watson. He used to
be a big politicianer in his day an’ time.
He’s my father-in-law.”</p>

<p>Uncle Billy seemed to be wonderfully
proud of his connection with Colonel Watson.
As for the Colonel, he eyed the strangers
closely, apparently forgetting to respond
to their salutation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>“I reckon you think it’s mighty fine,
thish ’ere business er gwine ter war whar
they hain’t nobody but peaceable folks,” exclaimed
the colonel, his shrill, metallic voice
being in curious contrast to his emaciated
figure.</p>

<p>“Daddy!” said Mrs. Powers in a warning
tone.</p>

<p>“Lord A’mighty! don’t pester me, Crissy
Jane. Hain’t I done seed war before?
When I was in the legislatur’ didn’t the
boys rig up an’ march away to Mexico?
But you know yourself,” the colonel went
on, turning to Uncle Billy’s guests, “that
this hain’t Mexico, an’ that they hain’t no
war gwine on on this ’ere hill. You know
that mighty well.”</p>

<p>“But there’s a tolerable big one going on
over yonder,” said Captain Moseley, with a
sweep of his hand to the westward.</p>

<p>“Now, you don’t say!” exclaimed Colonel
Watson, sarcastically. “A big war going
on an’ you all quiled up here before the
fire, out ’n sight an’ out ’n hearin’! Well,
well, well!”</p>

<p>“We are here on business,” said Captain
Moseley, gently.</p>

<p>“Tooby shore!” said the Colonel, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
sinister screech that was intended to simulate
laughter. “You took the words out ’n
my mouth. I was in-about ready to say it
when you upped an’ said it yourself. War
gwine on over yander an’ you all up here on
business. Crissy Jane,” remarked the colonel
in a different tone, “come here an’ wipe
my face an’ see ef I’m a-sweatin’. Ef I’m
a-sweatin’, hit’s the fust time since Sadday
before last.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Powers mopped her father’s face,
and assured him that she felt symptoms of
perspiration.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” continued the colonel.
“Business here an’ war yander. I hear tell
that you er after Israel Spurlock. Lord
A’mighty above us! What er you after
Israel for? He hain’t got no niggers for to
fight for. All the fightin’ he can do is to
fight for his ole mammy.”</p>

<p>Captain Moseley endeavored to explain to
Colonel Watson why his duty made it imperatively
necessary to carry Spurlock back
to the conscript camp, but in the midst of it
all the old man cried out:—</p>

<p>“Oh, I know who sent you!”</p>

<p>“Who?” the captain said.</p>

<p>“Nobody but Wesley Lovejoy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Moseley made no response, but
gazed into the fire. Chadwick, on the other
hand, when Lovejoy’s name was mentioned,
slapped himself on the leg, and straightened
himself up with the air of a man who has
made an interesting discovery.</p>

<p>“Come, now,” Colonel Watson insisted,
“hain’t it so? Didn’t Wesley Lovejoy
send you?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Moseley, “a man named
Lovejoy is on Colonel Waring’s staff, and
he gave me my orders.”</p>

<p>At this the old man fairly shrieked with
laughter, and so sinister was its emphasis
that the two soldiers felt the cold chills
creeping up their backs.</p>

<p>“What is the matter with Lovejoy?” It
was Chadwick who spoke.</p>

<p>“Oh, wait!” cried Colonel Watson;
“thes wait. You mayn’t want to wait, but
you’ll have to. I may look like I’m mighty
puny, an’ I ’spec’ I am, but I hain’t dead
yit. Lord A’mighty, no! Not by a long
shot!”</p>

<p>There was a pause here, during which
Aunt Crissy remarked, in a helpless sort of
way:—</p>

<p>“I wonder wher’ Polly is, an’ what she’s
a-doin’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>“Don’t pester ’long of Polly,” snapped
the paralytic. “She knows what she’s a-doin’.”</p>

<p>“About this Wesley Lovejoy,” said Captain
Moseley, turning to the old man: “you
seem to know him very well.”</p>

<p>“You hear that, William!” exclaimed
Colonel Watson. “He asts me ef I know
Wes. Lovejoy! Do I know him? Why,
the triflin’ houn’! I’ve knowed him ev’ry
sence he was big enough to rob a hen-roos’.”</p>

<p>Uncle Billy Powers, in his genial way,
tried to change the current of conversation,
and he finally succeeded, but it was evident
that Adjutant Lovejoy had one enemy, if
not several, in that humble household.
Such was the feeling for Spurlock and contempt
for Wesley Lovejoy that Captain
Moseley and Private Chadwick felt themselves
to be interlopers, and they once more
suggested the necessity of pursuing their
journey. This suggestion seemed to amuse
the paralytic, who laughed loudly.</p>

<p>“Lord A’mighty!” he exclaimed, “I
know how you feel, an’ I don’t blame you
for feelin’ so; but don’t you go up the
mountain this night. Thes stay right whar
you is, beca’se ef you don’t you’ll make all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
your friends feel bad for you. Don’t ast
me how, don’t ast me why. Thes you stay.
Come an’ put me to bed, William, an’ don’t
let these folks go out ’n the house this night.”</p>

<p>Uncle Billy carried the old man into the
next room, tucked him away in his bed, and
then came back. Conversation lagged to
such an extent that Aunt Crissy once more
felt moved to inquire about Polly. Uncle
Billy responded with a sweeping gesture of
his right hand, which might mean much or
little. To the two Confederates it meant
nothing, but to Aunt Crissy it said that
Polly had gone up the mountain in the rain
and cold. Involuntarily the woman shuddered
and drew nearer the fire.</p>

<p>It was in fact a venturesome journey that
Polly had undertaken. Hardened as she
was to the weather, familiar as she was with
the footpaths that led up and down and
around the face of the mountain, her heart
rose in her mouth when she found herself
fairly on the way to Israel Spurlock’s house.
The darkness was almost overwhelming in
its intensity. As Uncle Billy Powers remarked
while showing the two Confederates
to their beds in the “shed-room,” there “was
a solid chunk of it from one eend of creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
to t’ other.” The rain, falling steadily
but not heavily, was bitterly cold, and it
was made more uncomfortable by the wind,
which rose and fell with a muffled roar, like
the sigh of some Titanic spirit flying hither
and yonder in the wild recesses of the sky.
Bold as she was, the girl was appalled by the
invisible contention that seemed to be going
on in the elements above her, and more than
once she paused, ready to flee, as best she
could, back to the light and warmth she had
left behind; but the gesture of Chadwick,
with its cruel significance, would recur to
her, and then, clenching her teeth, she would
press blindly on. She was carrying a message
of life and freedom to Israel Spurlock.</p>

<p>With the rain dripping from her hair and
her skirts, her face and hands benumbed
with cold, but with every nerve strung to
the highest tension and every faculty alert
to meet whatever danger might present itself,
Polly struggled up the mountain path,
feeling her way as best she could, and pulling
herself along by the aid of the friendly
saplings and the overhanging trees.</p>

<p>After a while—and it seemed a long
while to Polly, contending with the fierce
forces of the night and beset by a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
doubts and fears—she could hear Spurlock’s
dogs barking. What if the two soldiers,
suspecting her mission, had mounted their
horses and outstripped her? She had no
time to remember the difficulties of the
mountain road, nor did she know that she
had been on her journey not more than half
an hour. She was too excited either to reason
or to calculate. Gathering her skirts
in her hands as she rose to the level of the
clearing, Polly rushed across it towards the
little cabin, tore open the frail little gate,
and flung herself against the door with a
force that shook the house.</p>

<p>Old Mrs. Spurlock was spinning, while Israel
carded the rolls for her. The noise
that Polly made against the door startled
them both. The thread broke in Mrs.
Spurlock’s hand, and one part of it curled
itself on the end of the broach with a buzz
that whirled it into a fantastically tangled
mass. The cards dropped from Israel’s
hands with a clatter that added to his mother’s
excitement.</p>

<p>“Did anybody ever hear the beat of
that?” she exclaimed. “Run, Iserl, an’
see what it is that’s a-tryin’ to tear the roof
off ’n the house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Israel did not need to be told, nor did
Mrs. Spurlock wait for him to go. They
reached the door together, and when Israel
threw it open they saw Polly Powers standing
there, pale, trembling, and dripping.</p>

<p>“Polly!” cried Israel, taking her by the
arm. He could say no more.</p>

<p>“In the name er the Lord!” exclaimed
Mrs. Spurlock, “wher’ ’d you drop from?
You look more like a drownded ghost than
you does like folks. Come right in here an’
dry yourse’f. What in the name of mercy
brung you out in sech weather? Who’s
dead or a-dyin’? Why, look at the gal!”
Mrs. Spurlock went on in a louder tone, seeing
that Polly stood staring at them with
wide-open eyes, her face as pale as death.</p>

<p>“Have they come?” gasped Polly.</p>

<p>“Listen at ’er, Iserl! I b’lieve in my
soul she’s done gone an’ run ravin’ deestracted.
Shake ’er, Iserl; shake ’er.”</p>

<p>For answer Polly dropped forward into
Mrs. Spurlock’s arms, all wet as she was,
and there fell to crying in a way that was
quite alarming to Israel, who was not familiar
with feminine peculiarities. Mrs.
Spurlock soothed Polly as she would have
soothed a baby, and half carried, half led<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
her to the fireplace. Israel, who was standing
around embarrassed and perplexed, was
driven out of the room, and soon Polly was
decked out in dry clothes. These “duds,”
as Mrs. Spurlock called them, were ill-fitting
and ungraceful, but in Israel’s eyes the girl
was just as beautiful as ever. She was even
more beautiful when, fully recovered from
her excitement, she told with sparkling eyes
and heightened color the story she had to
tell.</p>

<p>Mrs. Spurlock listened with the keenest
interest, and with many an exclamation of
indignation, while Israel heard it with undisguised
admiration for the girl. He seemed
to enjoy the whole proceeding, and when
Polly in the ardor and excitement of her
narration betrayed an almost passionate interest
in his probable fate, he rubbed his
hands slowly together and laughed softly to
himself.</p>

<p>“An’ jest to think,” exclaimed Polly,
when she had finished her story, “that that
there good-for-nothin’ Wesley Lovejoy had
the imperdence to ast me to have him no
longer ’n last year, an’ he’s been a-flyin’
round me constant.”</p>

<p>“I seed him a-droppin’ his wing,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Israel, laughing. “I reckon that’s the reason
he’s after me so hot. But never you
mind, mammy; you thes look after the gal
that’s gwine to be your daughter-in-law, an’
I’ll look after your son.”</p>

<p>“Go off, you goose!” cried Polly, blushing
and smiling. “Ef they hang you, whose
daughter-in-law will I be then?”</p>

<p>“The Lord knows!” exclaimed Israel,
with mock seriousness. “They tell me that
Lovejoy is an orphan!”</p>

<p>“You must be crazy,” cried Polly, indignantly.
“I hope you don’t think I’d marry
that creetur. I wouldn’t look at him if he
was the last man. You better be thinkin’
about your goozle.”</p>

<p>“It’s ketchin’ befo’ hangin’,” said Israel.</p>

<p>“They’ve mighty nigh got you now,”
said Polly. Just then a hickory nut dropped
on the roof of the house, and the noise
caused the girl to start up with an exclamation
of terror.</p>

<p>“You thought they had me then,” said
Israel, as he rose and stood before the fire,
rubbing his hands together, and seeming to
enjoy most keenly the warm interest the
girl manifested in his welfare.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wisht you’d cut an’ run,” pleaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Polly, covering her face with her hands;
“they’ll be here therreckly.”</p>

<p>Israel was not a bad-looking fellow as he
stood before the fire laughing. He was a
very agreeable variation of the mountain
type. He was angular, but neither stoop-shouldered
nor cadaverous. He was awkward
in his manners, but very gracefully
fashioned. In point of fact, as Mrs. Powers
often remarked, Israel was “not to be
sneezed at.”</p>

<p>After a while he became thoughtful. “I
jest tell you what,” he said, kicking the
chunks vigorously, and sending little sparks
of fire skipping and cracking about the
room. “This business puzzles me—I jest
tell you it does. That Wes. Lovejoy done
like he was the best friend I had. He was
constantly huntin’ me up in camp, an’ when
I told him I would like to come home an’
git mammy’s crap in, he jest laughed an’
said he didn’t reckon I’d be missed much,
an’ now he’s a-houndin’ me down. What
has the man got agin me?”</p>

<p>Polly knew, but she didn’t say. Mrs.
Spurlock suspected, but she made no effort
to enlighten Israel. Polly knew that Lovejoy
was animated by blind jealousy, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
instinct taught her that a jealous man is
usually a dangerous one. Taking advantage
of one of the privileges of her sex, she had
at one time carried on a tremendous flirtation
with Lovejoy. She had intended to
amuse herself simply, but she had kindled
fires she was powerless to quench. Lovejoy
had taken her seriously, and she knew well
enough that he regarded Israel Spurlock as
a rival. She had reason to suspect, too,
that Lovejoy had pointed out Israel to the
conscript officers, and that the same influence
was controlling and directing the pursuit
now going on.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, her concern—her
alarm, indeed—was natural. She and
Israel had been sweethearts for years,—real
sure-enough sweethearts, as she expressed
it to her grandfather,—and they
were to be married in a short while; just as
soon, in fact, as the necessary preliminaries
of clothes-making and cake-baking could be
disposed of. She thought nothing of her
feat of climbing the mountain in the bitter
cold and the overwhelming rain. She would
have taken much larger risks than that;
she would have faced any danger her mind
could conceive of. And Israel appreciated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
it all; nay, he fairly gloated over it. He
stood before the fire fairly hugging the fact
to his bosom. His face glowed, and his
whole attitude was one of exultation; and
with it, shaping every gesture and movement,
was a manifestation of fearlessness
which was all the more impressive because
it was unconscious.</p>

<p>This had a tendency to fret Polly, whose
alarm for Israel’s safety was genuine.</p>

<p>“Oh, I do wisht you’d go on,” she cried;
“them men’ll shorely ketch you ef you keep
on a-stayin’ here a-winkin’ an’ a-gwine on
makin’ monkey motions.”</p>

<p>“Shoo!” exclaimed Israel. “Ef the
house was surrounded by forty thousan’ of
’em, I’d git by ’em, an’, ef need be, take
you wi’ me.”</p>

<p>While they were talking the dogs began
to bark. At the first sound Polly rose from
her chair with her arms outstretched, but
fell back pale and trembling. Israel had
disappeared as if by magic, and Mrs. Spurlock
was calmly lighting her pipe by filling
it with hot embers. It was evidently a
false alarm, for, after a while, Israel backed
through the doorway and closed the door
again with comical alacrity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sh-sh-sh!” he whispered, with a warning
gesture, seeing that Polly was about to
protest. “Don’t make no fuss. The dogs
has been a-barkin’ at sperits an’ things.
Jest keep right still.”</p>

<p>He went noiselessly about the room, picking
up first one thing and then another.
Over one shoulder he flung a canteen, and
over the other a hunting-horn. Into his
coat-pocket he thrust an old-fashioned powder-flask.
Meanwhile his mother was busy
gathering together such articles as Israel
might need. His rifle she placed by the
door, and then she filled a large homespun
satchel with a supply of victuals—a baked
fowl, a piece of smoked beef, and a big
piece of light bread. These preparations
were swiftly and silently made. When
everything seemed to be ready for his departure
Israel presented the appearance of a
peddler.</p>

<p>“I’m goin’ up to the Rock,” he said, by
way of explanation, “an’ light the fire.
Maybe the boys’ll see it, an’ maybe they
won’t. Leastways they’re mighty apt to
smell the smoke.”</p>

<p>Then, without further farewell, he closed
the door and stepped out into the darkness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
leaving the two women sitting by the hearth.
They sat there for hours, gazing into the
fire and scarcely speaking to each other.
The curious reticence that seems to be developed
and assiduously cultivated by the
dwellers on the mountains took possession
of them. The confidences and sympathies
they had in common were those of observation
and experience, rather than the result
of an interchange of views and opinions.</p>

<p>Towards morning the drizzling rain
ceased, and the wind, changing its direction,
sent the clouds flying to the east, whence
they had come. About dawn, Private Chadwick,
who had slept most soundly, was
aroused by the barking of the dogs, and got
up to look after the horses. As he slipped
quietly out of the house he saw a muffled
figure crossing the yard.</p>

<p>“Halt!” he cried, giving the challenge
of a sentinel. “Who goes there?”</p>

<p>“Nobody ner nothin’ that’ll bite you, I
reckon,” was the somewhat snappish response.
It was the voice of Polly. She
was looking up and across the mountains to
where a bright red glare was reflected on
the scurrying clouds. The density of the
atmosphere was such that the movements of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the flames were photographed on the clouds,
rising and falling, flaring and fading, as
though the dread spirits of the storm were
waving their terrible red banners from the
mountain.</p>

<p>“What can that be?” asked Chadwick,
after he had watched the singular spectacle
a moment.</p>

<p>Polly laughed aloud, almost joyously. She
knew it was Israel’s beacon. She knew
that these red reflections, waving over the
farther spur of the mountain and over the
valley that nestled so peacefully below,
would summon half a hundred men and
boys—the entire congregation of Antioch
Church, where her father was in the habit
of holding forth on the first Sunday of each
month. She knew that Israel was safe, and
the knowledge restored her good humor.</p>

<p>“What did you say it was?” Chadwick
inquired again, his curiosity insisting on an
explanation.</p>

<p>“It’s jest a fire, I reckon,” Polly calmly
replied. “Ef it’s a house burnin’ down, it
can’t be holp. Water couldn’t save it
now.”</p>

<p>Whereupon she pulled the shawl from over
her head, tripped into the house, and went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
about preparing breakfast, singing merrily.
Chadwick watched her as she passed and repassed
from the rickety kitchen to the house,
and when the light grew clearer he thought
he saw on her face a look that he did not
understand. It was indeed an inscrutable
expression, and it would have puzzled a
wiser man than Chadwick. He chopped
some wood, brought some water, and made
himself generally useful; but he received
no thanks from Polly. She ignored him as
completely as if he had never existed.</p>

<p>All this set the private to thinking. Now
a man who reflects much usually thinks
out a theory to fit everything that he fails
to understand. Chadwick thought out his
theory while the girl was getting breakfast
ready.</p>

<p>It was not long before the two soldiers
were on their way up the mountain, nor was
it long before Chadwick began to unfold
his theory, and in doing so he managed to
straighten it by putting together various little
facts that occurred to him as he talked.</p>

<p>“I tell you what, Captain,” he said, as
soon as they were out of hearing; “that gal’s
a slick ’un. It’s my belief that we are
gwine on a fool’s errand. ’Stead of gwine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
towards Spurlock, we’re gwine straight
away from ’im. When that gal made her
disappearance last night she went an’ found
Spurlock, an’ ef he ain’t a natchul born fool
he tuck to the woods. Why, the shawl the
gal had on her head this mornin’ was soakin’
wet. It weren’t rainin’, an’ hadn’t been
for a right smart while. How come the
shawl wet? They weren’t but one way.
It got wet by rubbin’ agin the bushes an’
the limbs er the trees.”</p>

<p>This theory was plausible enough to impress
itself on Captain Moseley. “What
is to be done, then?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, the Lord knows what ought to be
done,” said Chadwick; “but I reckon the
best plan is to sorter scatter out an’ skirmish
aroun’ a little bit. We’d better divide
our army. You go up the mountain an’ git
Spurlock, if he’s up thar, an’ let me take
my stan’ on the ridge yander an’ keep my
eye on Uncle Billy’s back yard an’ hoss lot.
If Spurlock is r’ally tuck to the woods, he’ll
be mighty apt to be slinkin’ ’roun’ whar the
gal is.”</p>

<p>Captain Moseley assented to this plan,
and proceeded to put it in execution as soon
as he and Chadwick were a safe distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
from Uncle Billy Powers’s house. Chadwick,
dismounting, led his horse along a cow-path
that ran at right angles to the main
road, and was soon lost to sight, while the
captain rode forward on his mission.</p>

<p>Of the two, as it turned out, the captain
had much the more comfortable experience.
He reached the Spurlock house in the course
of three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>In response to his halloo Mrs. Spurlock
came to the door.</p>

<p>“I was a-spinnin’ away for dear life,”
she remarked, brushing her gray hair from
her face, “when all of a sudden I hearn a
fuss, an’ I ’lows ter myself, says I, ‘I’ll be
boun’ that’s some one a-hailin’,’ says I; an’
then I dropped ever’thin’ an’ run ter the
door an’ shore enough it was. Won’t you
’light an’ come in?” she inquired with ready
hospitality. Her tone was polite, almost
obsequious.</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Israel Spurlock at home?” the
captain asked.</p>

<p>“Not, as you might say, adzackly at
home, but I reckon in reason it won’t be
long before he draps in. He hain’t had his
breakfas’ yit, though hit’s been a-waitin’ for
him tell hit’s stone col’. The cows broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
out last night, an’ he went off a-huntin’ of
’em time it was light good. Iserl is thes ez
rank after his milk ez some folks is after
the’r dram. I says, says I, ‘Shorely you
kin do ’thout your milk one mornin’ in the
year;’ but he wouldn’t nigh hear ter that.
He thes up an’ bolted off.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ride on,” said the captain. “Maybe
I’ll meet him coming back. Good-by.”</p>

<p>It was an uneventful ride, but Captain
Moseley noted one curious fact. He had
not proceeded far when he met two men
riding down the mountain. Each carried a
rifle flung across his saddle in front of him.
They responded gravely to the captain’s salutation.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Israel Spurlock this
morning?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I hain’t saw him,” answered
one. The other shook his head. Then
they rode on down the mountain.</p>

<p>A little farther on Captain Moseley met
four men. These were walking, but each
was armed—three with rifles, and one with
a shot-gun. They had not seen Spurlock.
At intervals he met more than a dozen—some
riding and some walking, but all
armed. At last he met two that presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
something of a contrast to the others. They
were armed, it is true; but they were laughing
and singing as they went along the road,
and while they had not seen Spurlock with
their own eyes, as they said, they knew he
must be farther up the mountain, for they
had heard of him as they came along.</p>

<p>Riding and winding around upward, Captain
Moseley presently saw a queer-looking
little chap coming towards him. The little
man had a gray beard, and as he walked he
had a movement like a camel. Like a
camel, too, he had a great hump on his back.
His legs were as long as any man’s, but his
whole body seemed to be contracted in his
hump. He was very spry, too, moving
along as active as a boy, and there was an
elfish expression on his face such as one
sees in old picture-books—a cunning, leering
expression, which yet had for its basis
the element of humor. The little man carried
a rifle longer than himself, which he
flourished about with surprising ease and
dexterity—practicing apparently some new
and peculiar manual.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Israel Spurlock?” inquired
Captain Moseley, reining in his
horse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes! Oh, yes! Goodness gracious,
yes!” replied the little man, grinning good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“Where is he now?” asked the captain.</p>

<p>“All about. Yes! All around! Gracious,
yes!” responded the little man, with
a sweeping gesture that took in the whole
mountain. Then he seemed to be searching
eagerly in the road for something. Suddenly
pausing, he exclaimed: “Here’s his
track right now! Oh, yes! Right fresh,
too! Goodness, yes!”</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” Moseley asked,
smiling at the antics of the little man, their
nimbleness being out of all proportion to
his deformity.</p>

<p>For answer the little man whirled his
rifle over his hump and under his arm, and
caught it as it went flying into the air.
Then he held it at a “ready,” imitating
the noise of the lock with his mouth, took
aim and made believe to fire, all with indescribable
swiftness and precision. Captain
Moseley rode on his way laughing; but,
laugh as he would, he could not put out of
his mind the queer impression the little man
had made on him, nor could he rid himself
of a feeling of uneasiness. Taking little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
notice of the landmarks that ordinarily attract
the notice of the traveler in a strange
country, he suddenly found himself riding
along a level stretch of tableland. The
transformation was complete. The country
roads seemed to cross and recross here,
coming and going in every direction. He
rode by a little house that stood alone in the
level wood, and he rightly judged it to be a
church. He drew rein and looked around
him. Everything was unfamiliar. In the
direction from which he supposed he had
come, a precipice rose sheer from the tableland
more than three hundred feet. At that
moment he heard a shout, and looking up
he beheld the hunchback flourishing his
long rifle and cutting his queer capers.</p>

<p>The situation was so puzzling that Captain
Moseley passed his hand over his eyes,
as if to brush away a scene that confused
his mind and obstructed his vision. He
turned his horse and rode back the way he
had come, but it seemed to be so unfamiliar
that he chose another road, and in the
course of a quarter of an hour he was compelled
to acknowledge that he was lost.
Everything appeared to be turned around,
even the little church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Private Chadwick was having
an experience of his own. In parting from
Captain Moseley he led his horse through
the bushes, following for some distance a
cow-path. This semblance of a trail terminated
in a “blind path,” and this Chadwick
followed as best he could, picking his way
cautiously and choosing ground over which
his horse could follow. He had to be very
careful. There were no leaves on the trees,
and the undergrowth was hardly thick
enough to conceal him from the keen eyes
of the mountaineers. Finally he tied his
horse in a thicket of black-jacks, where he
had the whole of Uncle Billy Powers’s little
farm under his eye. His position was not
an uncomfortable one. Sheltered from the
wind, he had nothing to do but sit on a huge
chestnut log and ruminate, and make a note
of the comings and goings on Uncle Billy’s
premises.</p>

<p>Sitting thus, Chadwick fell to thinking;
thinking, he fell into a doze. He caught
himself nodding more than once, and upbraided
himself bitterly. Still he nodded—he,
a soldier on duty at his post. How
long he slept he could not tell, but he suddenly
awoke to find himself dragged backward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
from the log by strong hands. He
would have made some resistance, for he
was a fearless man at heart and a tough
one to handle in a knock-down and drag-out
tussle; but resistance was useless. He had
been taken at a disadvantage, and before he
could make a serious effort in his own behalf,
he was lying flat on his back, with his
hands tied, and as helpless as an infant.
He looked up and discovered that his captor
was Israel Spurlock.</p>

<p>“Well, blame my scaly hide!” exclaimed
Chadwick, making an involuntary effort to
free his hands. “You’re the identical man
I’m a-huntin’.”</p>

<p>“An’ now you’re sorry you went an’
foun’ me, I reckon,” said Israel.</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t as glad as I ’lowed I’d
be,” said Chadwick. “Yit nuther am I so
mighty sorry. One way or ’nother I knowed
in reason I’d run up on you.”</p>

<p>“You’re mighty right,” responded Israel,
smiling not ill-naturedly. “You fell in my
arms same as a gal in a honeymoon.
Lemme lift you up, as the mule said when
he kicked the nigger over the fence. Maybe
you’ll look purtier when you swap een’s.”
Thereupon Israel helped Chadwick to his
feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“You ketched me that time, certain and
shore,” said the latter, looking at Spurlock
and laughing; “they ain’t no two ways
about that. I was a-settin’ on the log thar,
a-noddin’ an’ a-dreamin’ ’bout Christmas.
’T ain’t many days off, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” exclaimed Spurlock, sarcastically;
“a mighty purty dream, I bet a
hoss. You was fixin’ up for to cram me in
Lovejoy’s stockin’. A mighty nice present
I’d ’a’ been, tooby shore. Stidder hangin’
up his stockin’, Lovejoy was a-aimin’ for to
hang me up. Oh, yes! Christmas dreams
is so mighty nice an’ fine, I’m a great min’
to set right down here an’ have one er my
own—one of them kin’ er dreams what’s
got forked tail an’ fireworks mixed up on it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Chadwick, with some seriousness,
“whose stockin’ is you a-gwine to
cram me in?”</p>

<p>“In whose else’s but Danny Lemmons’s?
An’ won’t he holler an’ take on? Why, I
wouldn’t miss seein’ Danny Lemmons take
on for a hat full er shinplasters. Dang my
buttons ef I would!”</p>

<p>Chadwick looked at his captor with some
curiosity. There was not a trace of ill-feeling
or bad humor in Spurlock’s tone, nor in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
his attitude. The situation was so queer
that it was comical, and Chadwick laughed
aloud as he thought about it. In this Spurlock
heartily joined him, and the situation
would have seemed doubly queer to a
passer-by chancing along and observing captor
and prisoner laughing and chatting so
amiably together.</p>

<p>“Who, in the name of goodness, is Danny
Lemmons?”</p>

<p>“Lord!” exclaimed Spurlock, lifting
both hands, “don’t ast me about Danny
Lemmons. He’s—he’s—well, I tell you
what, he’s the bull er the woods, Danny
Lemmons is; nuther more ner less. He
hain’t bigger ’n my two fists, an’ he’s ’flicted,
an’ he’s all crippled up in his back,
whar he had it broke when he was a baby,
an’ yit he’s in-about the peartest man on
the mountain, an’ he’s the toughest an’ the
sooplest. An’ more ’n that, he’s got them
things up here,” Spurlock went on, tapping
his head significantly. Chadwick understood
this to mean that Lemmons, whatever
might be his afflictions, had brains enough
and to spare.</p>

<p>There was a pause in the conversation,
and then Chadwick, looking at his bound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
wrists, which were beginning to chafe and
swell, spoke up.</p>

<p>“What’s your will wi’ me?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Spurlock, rising to his feet,
“I’m a-gwine to empty your gun, an’ tote
your pistol for you, an’ invite you down to
Uncle Billy’s. Oh, you needn’t worry,”
he went on, observing Chadwick’s disturbed
expression, “they’re expectin’ of you.
Polly’s tol’ ’em you’d likely come back.”</p>

<p>“How did Polly know?” Chadwick inquired.</p>

<p>“Danny Lemmons tol’ ’er.”</p>

<p>“By George!” exclaimed Chadwick,
“the woods is full of Danny Lemmons.”</p>

<p>“Why, bless your heart,” said Spurlock,
“he thes swarms roun’ here.”</p>

<p>After Spurlock had taken the precaution
to possess himself of Chadwick’s arms and
ammunition, he cut the cords that bound
his prisoner’s hands, and the two went down
the mountain, chatting as pleasantly and as
sociably as two boon companions. Chadwick
found no lack of hospitality at Uncle
Billy Powers’s house. His return was taken
as a matter of course, and he was made welcome.
Nevertheless, his entertainers betrayed
a spirit of levity that might have irritated
a person less self-contained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see he’s ketched you, Iserl,” remarked
Uncle Billy, with a twinkle in his eye. “He
’lowed las’ night as how he’d fetch you back
wi’ him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Israel, “he thes crope up on
me. It’s mighty hard for to fool these
army fellers.”</p>

<p>Then and afterward the whole family pretended
to regard Spurlock as Chadwick’s
prisoner. This was not a joke for the latter
to relish, but it was evidently not intended
to be offensive, and he could do no less than
humor it. He accepted the situation philosophically.
He even prepared himself to
relish Captain Moseley’s astonishment when
he returned and discovered the true state of
affairs. As the day wore away it occurred
to Chadwick that the captain was in no
hurry to return. Even Uncle Billy Powers
grew uneasy.</p>

<p>“Now, I do hope an’ trust he ain’t gone
an’ lost his temper up thar in the woods,”
remarked Uncle Billy. “I hope it from
the bottom of my heart. These here wars
an’ rumors of wars makes the folks mighty
restless. They’ll take resks now what they
wouldn’t dassent to of tuck before this here
rippit begun, an’ it’s done got so now human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
life ain’t wuth shucks. The boys up here
ain’t no better ’n the rest. They fly to
pieces quicker ’n they ever did.”</p>

<p>No trouble, however, had come to Captain
Moseley. Though he was confused in
his bearings, he was as serene and as unruffled
as when training a company of raw conscripts
in the art of war. After an unsuccessful
attempt to find the road he gave his
horse the rein, and that sensible animal, his
instinct sharpened by remembrance of Uncle
Billy Powers’s corn-crib and fodder,
moved about at random until he found that
he was really at liberty to go where he
pleased, and then he turned short about,
struck a little canter, and was soon going
down the road by which he had come. The
captain was as proud of this feat as if it
were due to his own intelligence, and he
patted the horse’s neck in an approving
way.</p>

<p>As Captain Moseley rode down the mountain,
reflecting, it occurred to him that his
expedition was taking a comical shape. He
had gone marching up the hill, and now he
came marching down again, and Israel Spurlock,
so far as the captain knew, was as far
from being a captive as ever—perhaps farther.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Thinking it all over in a somewhat
irritated frame of mind, Moseley remembered
Lovejoy’s eagerness to recapture
Spurlock. He remembered, also, what he
had heard the night before, and it was in no
pleasant mood that he thought it all over.
It was such an insignificant, such a despicable
affair, two men carrying out the jealous
whim of a little militia politician.</p>

<p>“It is enough, by George!” exclaimed
Captain Moseley aloud, “to make a sensible
man sick.”</p>

<p>“Lord, yes!” cried out a voice behind
him. Looking around, he saw the hunchback
following him. “That’s what I tell
’em; goodness, yes!”</p>

<p>“Now, look here!” said Captain Moseley,
reining in his horse, and speaking somewhat
sharply. “Are you following me, or
am I following you? I don’t want to be
dogged after in the bushes, much less in the
big road.”</p>

<p>“Ner me nurther,” said the hunchback,
in the cheerfulest manner. “An’ then
thar’s Spurlock—Lord, yes; I hain’t axt
him about it, but I bet a hoss he don’t like
to be dogged atter nuther.”</p>

<p>“My friend,” said Captain Moseley, “you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
seem to have a quick tongue. What is your
name?”</p>

<p>“Danny Lemmons,” said the other.
“Now don’t say I look like I ought to be
squoze. Ever’body inginer’lly says that,”
he went on with a grimace, “but I’ve
squoze lots more than what’s ever squoze me.
Lord, yes! Yes, siree! Men an’ gals tergether.
You ax ’em, an’ they’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>“Lemmons,” said the captain, repeating
the name slowly. “Well, you look it!”</p>

<p>“Boo!” cried Danny Lemmons, making
a horrible grimace; “you don’t know what
you’re a-talkin’ about. The gals all ’low
I’m mighty sweet. You ought to see me
when I’m rigged out in my Sunday-go-to-meetin’
duds. Polly Powers she ’lows I
look snatchin’. Lord, yes! Yes, siree! I’m
gwine down to Polly’s house now.”</p>

<p>Whereat he broke out singing, paraphrasing
an old negro ditty, and capering
about in the woods like mad.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Oh, I went down to Polly’s house,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">An’ she was not at home;</div>
<div class="verse">I set myself in the big arm-cheer</div>
<div class="verse indent1">An’ beat on the ol’ jaw bone.</div>
<div class="verse">Oh, rise up, Polly! Slap ’im on the jaw,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">An hit ’im in the eyeball—bim!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The song finished, Danny Lemmons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
walked on down the road ahead of the horse
in the most unconcerned manner. It was
part of Captain Moseley’s plan to stop at
Mrs. Spurlock’s and inquire for Israel.
This seemed to be a part of Danny’s plan
also, for he turned out of the main road and
went ahead, followed by the captain. There
were quite a number of men at Mrs. Spurlock’s
when Moseley rode up, and he noticed
that all were armed. Some were standing
listlessly about, leaning against the trees,
some were sitting in various postures, and
others were squatting around whittling: but
all had their guns within easy reach. Mrs.
Spurlock was walking about among them
smoking her pipe. By the strained and
awkward manner of the men as they returned
his salutation, or by some subtle instinct
he could not explain, Captain Moseley
knew that these men were waiting for
him, and that he was their prisoner. The
very atmosphere seemed to proclaim the
fact. Under his very eyes Danny Lemmons
changed from a grinning buffoon into a
quiet, self-contained man trained to the
habit of command. Recognizing the situation,
the old soldier made the most of it by
retaining his good humor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, boys,” he said, flinging a leg over
the pommel of his saddle, “I hope you are
not tired waiting for me.” The men exchanged
glances in a curious, shame-faced
sort of way.</p>

<p>“No,” said one; “we was thes a-settin’
here talkin’ ’bout ol’ times. We ’lowed
maybe you’d sorter git tangled up on the
hill thar, and so Danny Lemmons, he harked
back for to keep a’ eye on you.”</p>

<p>There was no disposition on the part of
this quiet group of men to be clamorous or
boastful. There was a certain shyness in
their attitude, as of men willing to apologize
for what might seem to be unnecessary rudeness.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” said Danny Lemmons,
“they ain’t a man on the mounting
that’s got a blessed thing agin you, ner agin
the tother feller, an’ they hain’t a man anywheres
aroun’ here that’s a-gwine to pester
you. We never brung you whar you is;
but now that you’re here we’re a-gwine to
whirl in an’ ast you to stay over an’ take
Christmas wi’ us, sech ez we’ll have. Lord,
yes! a nice time we’ll have, ef I ain’t forgot
how to finger the fiddle-strings. We’re
sorter in a quandary,” Danny Lemmons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
continued, observing Captain Moseley toying
nervously with the handle of his pistol.
“We don’t know whether you’re a-gwine
to be worried enough to start a row, or
whether you’re a-gwine to work up trouble.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Danny had brought his long
rifle into a position where it could be used
promptly and effectually. For answer Moseley
dismounted from his horse, unbuckled
his belt and flung it across his saddle, and
prepared to light his pipe.</p>

<p>“Now, then,” said Danny Lemmons,
“thes make yourself at home.”</p>

<p>Nothing could have been friendlier than
the attitude of the mountain men, nor freer
than their talk. Captain Moseley learned
that Danny Lemmons was acting under the
orders of Colonel Dick Watson, the virile
paralytic; that he and Chadwick were to be
held prisoners in the hope that Adjutant
Lovejoy would come in search of them—in
which event there would be developments of
a most interesting character.</p>

<p>So Danny Lemmons said, and so it turned
out; for one day while Moseley and Chadwick
were sitting on the sunny side of Uncle
Billy’s house, listening to the shrill, snarling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
tones of Colonel Watson, they heard a
shout from the roadside, and behold, there
was Danny Lemmons with his little band
escorting Lovejoy and a small squad of forlorn-looking
militia. Lovejoy was securely
bound to his horse, and it may well be supposed
that he did not cut an imposing figure.
Yet he was undaunted. He was captured,
but not conquered. His eyes never lost
their boldness, nor his tongue its bitterness.
He was almost a match for Colonel Watson,
who raved at all things through the tremulous
and vindictive lips of disease. The
colonel’s temper was fitful, but Lovejoy’s
seemed to burn steadily. Moved by contempt
rather than caution, he was economical
of his words, listening to the shrill invective
of the colonel patiently, but with a
curious flicker of his thin lips that caused
Danny Lemmons to study him intently. It
was Danny who discovered that Lovejoy’s
eyes never wandered in Polly’s direction,
nor settled on her, nor seemed to perceive
that she was in existence, though she was
flitting about constantly on the aimless little
errands that keep a conscientious housekeeper
busy.</p>

<p>Lovejoy was captured one morning and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
Christmas fell the next, and it was a
memorable Christmas to all concerned.
After breakfast Uncle Billy Powers produced
his Bible and preached a little sermon—a
sermon that was not the less meaty and
sincere, not the less wise and powerful, because
the English was ungrammatical and
the rhetoric uncouth. After it was over the
old man cleared his throat and remarked:—</p>

<p>“Brethern, we’re gethered here for to
praise the Lord an’ do his will. The quare
times that’s come on us has brung us face
to face with much that is unseemly in life,
an’ likely to fret the sperit an’ vex the understandin’.
Yit the Almighty is with us,
an’ of us, an’ among us; an’, in accordance
wi’ the commands delivered in this Book,
we’re here to fortify two souls in the’r
choice, an’ to b’ar testimony to the Word
that makes lawful marriage a sacrament.”</p>

<p>With that, Uncle Billy, fumbling in his
coat pockets, produced a marriage license,
called Israel Spurlock and his daughter before
him, and in simple fashion pronounced
the words that made them man and wife.</p>

<p>The dinner that followed hard on the wedding
was to the soldiers, who had been subsisting
on the tough rations furnished by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Confederate commissaries, by all odds the
chief event of the day. To them the resources
of the Powers household were wonderful
indeed. The shed-room, running the
whole length of the house and kitchen, was
utilized, and the dinner table, which was
much too small to accommodate the guests,
invited and uninvited, was supplemented by
the inventive genius of Private William
Chadwick, who, in the most unassuming
manner, had taken control of the whole affair.
He proved himself to be an invaluable
aid, and his good humor gave a lightness and
a zest to the occasion that would otherwise
have been sadly lacking.</p>

<p>Under his direction the tables were arranged
and the dinner set, and when the
politely impatient company were summoned
they found awaiting them a meal substantial
enough to remind them of the old days of
peace and prosperity. It was a genuine
Christmas dinner. In the centre of the
table there was a large bowl of egg-nog, and
this was flanked and surrounded by a huge
dish full of apple dumplings, a tremendous
chicken pie, barbecued shote, barbecued mutton,
a fat turkey, and all the various accompaniments
of a country feast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>When Uncle Billy Powers had said an
earnest and simple grace he gave his place
at the head of the table to Colonel Watson,
who had been brought in on his chair.
Aunt Crissy gave Chadwick the seat of
honor at the foot, and then the two old people
announced that they were ready to wait
on the company, with Mr. Chadwick to do
the carving. If the private betrayed any
embarrassment at all, he soon recovered
from it.</p>

<p>“It ain’t any use,” he said, glancing down
the table, “to call the roll. We’re all here
an’ accounted for. The only man or woman
that can’t answer to their name is Danny
Lemmons’s little brown fiddle, an’ I’ll bet a
sev’m-punce it’d skreak a little ef he tuck it
out’n the bag. But before we whirl in an’
make a charge three deep, le’ ’s begin right.
This is Christmas, and that bowl yander,
with the egg-nog in it, looks tired. Good
as the dinner is, it’s got to have a file leader.
We’ll start in with what looks the nighest
like Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Aunt Crissy, “I’ve been in
sech a swivet all day I don’t reelly reckon
the nog is wuth your while, but you’ll ha’
ter take it thes like you fin’ it. Hit’s sweetened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
wi’ long sweet’nin’, an’ it’ll ha’ ter be
dipped up wi’ a gourd an’ drunk out’n
cups.”</p>

<p>“Lord bless you, ma’am,” exclaimed Chadwick,
“they won’t be no questions axed ef
it’s got Christmas enough in it, an’ I reckon
it is, kaze I poured it in myself, an’ I can
hol’ up a jug as long as the nex’ man.”</p>

<p>Though it was sweetened with syrup, the
egg-nog was a success, for its strength could
not be denied.</p>

<p>“Ef I hadn’t ’a’ been a prisoner of war,
as you may say,” remarked Chadwick, when
the guests had fairly begun to discuss the
dinner, “I’d ’a’ got me a hunk of barbecue
an’ a dumplin’ or two, an’ a slice of that
chicken pie there—I’d ’a’ grabbed ’em up
an’ ’a’ made off down the mountain. Why,
I’ll tell you what’s the truth—I got a
whiff of that barbecue by daylight, an’ gentulmen,
it fairly made me dribble at the
mouth. Nex’ to Uncle Billy there, I was
the fust man at the pit.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Uncle Billy, laughing,
“that’s so. An’ you holp me a right smart.
I’ll say that.”</p>

<p>“An’ Spurlock, he got a whiff of it.
Didn’t you all notice, about the time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
was gittin’ married, how his mouth puckered
up? Along towards the fust I thought he
was fixin’ to dip down an’ give the bride a
smack. But, bless you, he had barbecue on
his min’, an’ the bride missed the buss.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t dare to buss me,” exclaimed
Polly, who was ministering to her grandfather.
“Leastways not right out there before
you all.”</p>

<p>“Please, ma’am, don’t you be skeered of
Iserl,” said Chadwick. “I kin take a quarter
of that shote an’ tole him plumb back to
camp.”</p>

<p>“Now I don’t like the looks er this,” exclaimed
Uncle Billy Powers, who had suddenly
discovered that Lovejoy, sitting by
the side of Danny Lemmons, was bound so
that it was impossible for him to eat in any
comfort. “Come, boys, this won’t do. I
don’t want to remember the time when any
livin’ human bein’ sot at my table on Christmas
day with his han’s tied. Come, now!”</p>

<p>“Why, tooby shore!” exclaimed Aunt
Crissy. “Turn the poor creetur loose.”</p>

<p>“Try it!” cried Colonel Watson, in his
shrill voice. “Jest try it!”</p>

<p>“Lord, no,” said Danny Lemmons.
“Look at his eyes! Look at ’em.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Lovejoy sat pale and unabashed, his eyes
glittering like those of a snake. He had refused
all offers of food, and seemed to be
giving all his attention to Israel Spurlock.</p>

<p>“What does Moseley say?” asked Colonel
Watson.</p>

<p>“Ah, he is your prisoner,” said Moseley.
“He never struck me as a dangerous man.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Chadwick, “ef there’s any
doubt, jest take ’im out in the yard an’ give
’im han’-roomance. Don’t let ’im turn this
table over, ’cause it’ll be a long time before
some of this company’ll see the likes of it
ag’in.”</p>

<p>It was clear that Lovejoy had no friends,
even among his comrades. It was clear,
too, that this fact gave him no concern. He
undoubtedly had more courage than his position
seemed to demand. He sat glaring at
Spurlock, and said never a word. Uncle
Billy Powers looked at him, and gave a sigh
that ended in a groan.</p>

<p>“Well, boys,” said the old man, “this is
my house, an’ he’s at my table. I reckon
we better ontie ’im, an’ let ’im git a mou’ful
ter eat. ’T ain’t nothin’ but Christian-like.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you reckon he’d better eat at the
second table?” inquired Chadwick. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
naïve suggestion provoked laughter and restored
good humor, and Colonel Watson
consented that Lovejoy should be released.
Danny Lemmons undertook this gracious
task. He had released Lovejoy’s right arm,
and was releasing the left, having to use his
teeth on one of the knots, when the prisoner
seized a fork—a large horn-handle affair,
with prongs an inch and a half long—and
as quick as a flash of lightning brought it
down on Danny Lemmons’s back. To those
who happened to be looking it seemed that
the fork had been plunged into the very
vitals of the hunchback.</p>

<p>The latter went down, dragging Lovejoy
after him. There was a short, sharp struggle,
a heavy thump or two, and then, before
the company realized what had happened,
Danny Lemmons rose to his feet laughing,
leaving Lovejoy lying on the floor, more
securely bound than ever.</p>

<p>“I reckon this fork’ll have to be washed,”
said Danny, lifting the formidable-looking
weapon from the floor.</p>

<p>There was more excitement after the
struggle was over than there had been or
could have been while it was going on.
Chadwick insisted on examining Danny
Lemmons’s back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’ve saw folks cut an’ slashed an’
stobbed before now,” he explained, “an’
they didn’t know they was hurt tell they
had done cooled off. They ain’t no holes
here an’ they ain’t no blood, but I could
’most take a right pine-blank oath that I
seed ’im job that fork in your back.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” said Colonel Watson. “Do
you s’pose I raised Danny Lemmons for the
like of that?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Chadwick, resuming his seat
and his dinner with unruffled nerves, temper,
and appetite, “it beats the known worl’.
It’s the fust time I ever seed a man git
down on the floor for to give the in-turn an’
the under-cut, an’ cut the pigeon-wing an’ the
double-shuffle, all before a cat could bat her
eye. It looks to me that as peart a man as
Lemmons there ought to be in the war.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t he in the war?” cried Colonel
Watson, excitedly. “Ain’t he forever and
eternally in the war? Ain’t he my bully
bushwhacker?”</p>

<p>“On what side?” inquired Chadwick.</p>

<p>“The Union, the Union!” exclaimed the
colonel, his voice rising into a scream.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Chadwick, “ef you think
you kin take the taste out’n this barbecue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
with talk like that, you are mighty much
mistaken.”</p>

<p>After the wedding feast was over, Danny
Lemmons seized on his fiddle and made music
fine enough and lively enough to set the
nimble feet of the mountaineers to dancing.
So that, take it all in all, the Christmas of
the conscript was as jolly as he could have
expected it to be.</p>

<p>When the festivities were concluded there
was a consultation between Colonel Watson
and Danny Lemmons, and then Captain
Moseley and his men were told that they
were free to go.</p>

<p>“What about Lovejoy?” asked Moseley.</p>

<p>“Oh, bless you! he goes over the mountain,”
exclaimed Danny, with a grin.
“Lord, yes! Right over the mountain.”</p>

<p>“Now, I say no,” said Polly, blushing.
“Turn the man loose an’ let him go.”</p>

<p>There were protests from some of the
mountaineers, but Polly finally had her way.
Lovejoy was unbound and permitted to go
with the others, who were escorted a piece
of the way down the mountain by Spurlock
and some of the others. When the mountaineers
started back, and before they had
got out of sight, Lovejoy seized a musket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
from one of his men and turned and ran a
little way back. What he would have done
will never be known, for before he could
raise his gun a streak of fire shot forth into
his face, and he fell and rolled to the side of
the road. An instant later Danny Lemmons
leaped from the bushes, flourishing his
smoking rifle.</p>

<p>“You see ’im now!” he cried. “You see
what he was atter! He’d better have gone
over the mountain. Lord, yes! Lots better.”</p>

<p>Moseley looked at Chadwick.</p>

<p>“Damn him!” said the latter; “he’s
got what he’s been a-huntin’ for.”</p>

<p>By this time the little squad of militia-men,
demoralized by the incident, had fled
down the mountain, and Moseley and his
companion hurried after them.</p>

<h2 id="ANANIAS">ANANIAS.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Middle Georgia, after Sherman passed
through on his famous march to the sea,
was full of the direst confusion and despair,
and there were many sad sights to be
seen. A wide strip of country with desolate
plantations, and here and there a lonely
chimney standing sentinel over a pile of
blackened and smouldering ruins, bore melancholy
testimony to the fact that war is a
very serious matter. All this is changed
now, of course. The section through which
the grim commander pushed his way to
the sea smiles under the application of new
and fresher energies. We have discovered
that war, horrible as it is, sometimes drags
at its bloody tumbril wheel certain fructifying
and fertilizing forces. If this were not
so, the contest in which the South suffered
the humiliation of defeat, and more, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
have been a very desperate affair indeed.
The troubles of that unhappy time—its
doubts, its difficulties, and its swift calamities—will
never be known to posterity,
for they have never been adequately described.</p>

<p>It was during this awful period—that is
to say, in January, 1866—that Lawyer
Terrell, of Macon, made the acquaintance of
his friend Ananias. In the midst of the
desolation to be seen on every hand, this
negro was the forlornest spectacle of all.
Lawyer Terrell overtook him on the public
highway between Macon and Rockville.
The negro wore a ragged blue army overcoat,
a pair of patched and muddy blue
breeches, and had on the remnants of what
was once a military cap. He was leading
a lame and broken-down horse through the
mud, and was making his way toward Rockville,
at what appeared to be a slow and
painful gait. Curiosity impelled Lawyer
Terrell to draw rein as he came up with the
negro.</p>

<p>“Howdy, boss?” said the negro, taking
off his tattered cap. Responding to his salutation,
the lawyer inquired his name. “I’m
name’ Ananias, suh,” he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>The name seemed to fit him exactly. A
meaner-looking negro Lawyer Terrell had
never seen. There was not the shadow of a
smile on his face, and seriousness ill became
him. He had what is called a hang-dog
look. A professional overseer in the old
days would have regarded him as a negro
to be watched, and a speculator would have
put him in chains the moment he bought
him. With a good deal of experience with
negroes, Lawyer Terrell had never seen one
whose countenance and manner were more
repulsive.</p>

<p>“Well,” said the lawyer, still keeping
along with him in the muddy road, “Ananias
is a good name.”</p>

<p>“Yasser,” he replied; “dat w’at mammy
say. Mammy done dead now, but she say
dat dey wuz two Ananiases. Dey wuz ole
Ananias en young Ananias. One un um
wuz de Liar, en de udder wuz de Poffit.
Dat w’at mammy say. I’m name’ atter de
Poffit.”</p>

<p>Lawyer Terrell laughed, and continued
his cross-examination.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“Who? Me? I’m gwine back ter Marster,
suh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is your master’s name?”</p>

<p>“Cunnel Benjamime Flewellen, suh.”</p>

<p>“Colonel Benjamin Flewellen; yes; I
know the colonel well. What are you going
back there for?”</p>

<p>“Who? Me? Dat my home, suh. I
bin brung up right dar, suh—right ’longside
er Marster en my young mistiss, suh.”</p>

<p>“Miss Ellen Flewellen,” said Lawyer
Terrell, reflectively. At this remark the
negro showed a slight interest in the conversation;
but his interest did not improve his
appearance.</p>

<p>“Yasser, dat her name, sho; but we-all
call her Miss Nelly.”</p>

<p>“A very pretty name, Ananias,” remarked
Lawyer Terrell.</p>

<p>“Lord! yasser.”</p>

<p>The negro looked up at this, but Lawyer
Terrell had his eyes fixed on the muddy
road ahead of him. The lawyer was somewhat
youngish himself, but his face had a
hard, firm expression common to those who
are in the habit of having their own way in
the court-house and elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Where have you been, Ananias?” said
the lawyer presently.</p>

<p>“Who? Me? I bin ’long wid Sherman
army, suh.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then you are quite a soldier by this
time.”</p>

<p>“Lord! yasser! I bin wid um fum de
time dey come in dese parts plum tell dey
got ter Sander’ville. You ain’t never is
bin ter Sander’ville, is you, boss?”</p>

<p>“Not to say right in the town, Ananias,
but I’ve been by there a great many times.”
Lawyer Terrell humored the conversation,
as was his habit.</p>

<p>“Well, suh,” said Ananias, “don’t you
never go dar; special don’t you go dar wid
no army, kase hit’s de longes’ en de nasties’
road fum dar ter yer w’en you er comin’
back, dat I ever is lay my two eyes on.”</p>

<p>“Why did you come back, Ananias?”</p>

<p>“Who? Me? Well, suh, w’en de army
come ’long by home dar, look like eve’ybody
got der eye sot on me. Go whar I would,
look alike all de folks wuz a-watchin’ me.
’Bout time de army wuz a-pilin’ in on us,
Marse Wash Jones, w’ich I never is done
’im no harm dat I knows un, he went ter
Marster, he did, en he ’low dat ef dey don’t
keep mighty close watch on Ananias dey’d
all be massycreed in deir beds. I know
Marse Wash tol’ Marster dat, kaze Ma’y
Ann, w’ich she wait on de table, she come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
right outer de house en tol’ me so. Right
den, suh, I ’gun ter feel sorter skittish.
Marster had done got me ter hide all de
stock out in de swamp, en I ’low ter myse’f,
I did, dat I’d des go over dar en stay wid
um. I ain’t bin dar so mighty long, suh,
w’en yer come de Yankees, en wid um wuz
George, de carriage driver, de nigger w’at
Marster think mo’ uv dan he do all de balance
er his niggers. En now, den, dar wuz
George a-fetchin’ de Yankees right whar he
know de stock wuz hid at.”</p>

<p>“George was a very handy negro to have
around,” said Lawyer Terrell.</p>

<p>“Yasser. Marster thunk de worl’ en all
er dat nigger, en dar he wuz showin’ de
Yankees whar de mules en hosses wuz hid
at. Well, suh, soon ez he see me, George
he put out, en I staid dar wid de hosses. I
try ter git dem folks not ter kyar um off, I
beg um en I plead wid um, but dey des
laugh at me, suh. I follered ’long atter
um’, en dey driv dem hosses en mules right
by de house. Marster wuz standin’ out in
de front porch, en w’en he see de Yankees
got de stock, en me ’long wid um, suh, he
des raise up his han’s—so—en drap um
down by his side, en den he tuck ’n tu’n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
roun’ en go in de house. I run ter de do’,
I did, but Marster done fasten it, en den I
run roun’ de back way, but de back do’ wuz
done fassen too. I know’d dey didn’t like
me,” Ananias went on, picking his way
carefully through the mud, “en I wuz mos’
out ’n my head, kaze I ain’t know w’at ter
do. ’T ain’t wid niggers like it is wid white
folks, suh. White folks know w’at ter do,
kaze dey in de habits er doin’ like dey wanter,
but niggers, suh—niggers, dey er diffunt.
Dey dunner w’at ter do.”</p>

<p>“Well, what did you do?” asked Lawyer
Terrell.</p>

<p>“Who? Me? Well, suh, I des crope
off ter my cabin, en I draw’d up a cheer
front er de fier, en stirred up de embers, en
sot dar. I ain’ sot dar long ’fo’ Marster
come ter de do’. He open it, he did, en he
come in. He ’low, ‘You in dar, Ananias?’
I say, ‘Yasser.’ Den he come in. He
stood dar, he did, en look at me. I ain’t
raise my eyes, suh; I des look in de embers.
Bime-by he say, ‘Ain’t I allers treat you
well, Ananias?’ I ’low, ‘Yasser.’ Den
he say, ‘Ain’t I raise you up fum a little
baby, w’en you got no daddy?’ I ’low, ‘Yasser.’
He say, ‘How come you treat me dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
a-way, Ananias? W’at make you show
dem Yankees whar my hosses en mules
is?’”</p>

<p>Ananias paused as he picked his way
through the mud, leading his broken-down
horse.</p>

<p>“What did you tell him?” said Lawyer
Terrell, somewhat curtly.</p>

<p>“Well, suh, I dunner w’at de name er
God come ’cross me. I wuz dat full up dat
I can’t talk. I tried ter tell Marster des
’zactly how it wuz, but look like I wuz all
choke up. White folks kin talk right
straight ’long, but niggers is diffunt. Marster
stood dar, he did, en look at me right
hard, en I know by de way he look dat his
feelin’s wuz hurted, en dis make me wuss.
Eve’y time I try ter talk, suh, sumpin’ ne’r
kotch me in de neck, en ’fo’ I kin come ter
myse’f, suh, Marster wuz done gone. I got
up en tried ter holler at ’im, but dat ketch
wuz dar in my neck, suh, en mo’ special wuz
it dar, suh, w’en I see dat he wuz gwine ’long
wid his head down; en dey mighty few folks,
suh, dat ever is see my marster dat a-way.
He kyar his head high, suh, ef I do say it
myse’f.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you follow after him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
tell him about it?” inquired Lawyer Terrell,
drawing his lap-robe closer about his
knee.</p>

<p>“Dat des zactly w’at I oughter done, suh;
but right den en dar I ain’t know w’at ter
do. I know’d dat nigger like me ain’t got
no business foolin’ ’roun’ much, en dat wuz
all I did know. I sot down, I did, en I
make up my min’ dat ef Marster got de
idee dat I had his stock run’d off, I better
git out fum dar; en den I went ter work,
suh, en I pack up w’at little duds I got, en
I put out wid de army. I march wid um,
suh, plum tell dey got ter Sander’ville, en
dar I ax um w’at dey gwine pay me fer
gwine wid um. Well, suh, you mayn’t
b’lieve me, but dem w’ite mens dey des
laugh at me. All dis time I bin runnin’
over in my min’ ’bout Marster en Miss
Nelly, en w’en I fin’ out dat dey wa’n’t no
pay fer niggers gwine wid de army I des
up en say ter myse’f dat dat kind er business
ain’t gwine do fer me.”</p>

<p>“If they had paid you anything,” said
Lawyer Terrell, “I suppose you would have
gone on with the army?”</p>

<p>“Who? Me? Dat I wouldn’t,” replied
Ananias, emphatically—“dat I wouldn’t.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
I’d ’a’ got my money, en I’d ’a’ come back
home, kaze I boun’ you I wa’n’t a-gwine ter
let Marster drap off and die widout knowin’
who run’d dem stock off. No, suh. I wuz
des ’bleege ter come back.”</p>

<p>“Ananias,” said Lawyer Terrell, “you
are a good man.”</p>

<p>“Thanky, suh!—thanky, marster!” exclaimed
Ananias, taking off his weather-beaten
cap. “You er de fus w’ite man dat
ever tol’ me dat sence I bin born’d inter de
worl’. Thanky, suh!”</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said Lawyer Terrell, touching
his horse lightly with the whip.</p>

<p>“Good-by, marster!” said Ananias, with
unction. “Good-by, marster! en thanky!”</p>

<p>Lawyer Terrell passed out of sight in the
direction of Rockville. Ananias went in the
same direction, but he made his way over the
road with a lighter heart.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>It is to be presumed that Ananias’s explanation
was satisfactory to Colonel Benjamin
Flewellen, for he settled down on his
former master’s place, and proceeded to make
his presence felt on the farm as it never had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
been felt before. Himself and his army-worn
horse were decided accessions, for the
horse turned out to be an excellent animal.
Ananias made no contract with his former
master, and asked for no wages. He simply
took possession of his old quarters, and
began anew the life he had led in slavery
times—with this difference: in the old days
he had been compelled to work, but now he
was working of his own free-will and to
please himself. The result was that he
worked much harder.</p>

<p>It may be said that though Colonel Benjamin
Flewellen was a noted planter, he was
not much of a farmer. Before and during
the war he had intrusted his plantation and
his planting in the care of an overseer. For
three hundred dollars a year—which was
not much of a sum in slavery times—he
could be relieved of all the cares and anxieties
incident to the management of a large
plantation. His father before him had conducted
the plantation by proxy, and Colonel
Flewellen was not slow to avail himself of a
long-established custom that had been justified
by experience. Moreover, Colonel Flewellen
had a taste for literature. His father
had gathered together a large collection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
books, and Colonel Flewellen had added to
this until he was owner of one of the largest
private libraries in a State where large private
libraries were by no means rare. He
wrote verse on occasion, and essays in defense
of slavery. There are yet living men
who believed that his “Reply” to Charles
Sumner’s attack on the South was so crushing
in its argument and its invective—particularly
its invective—that it would go far
toward putting an end to the abolition movement.
Colonel Flewellen’s “Reply” filled
a page of the New York “Day-Book,” and
there is no doubt that he made the most of
the limited space placed at his disposal.</p>

<p>With his taste and training it is not surprising
that Colonel Benjamin Flewellen
should leave his plantation interests to the
care of Mr. Washington Jones, his overseer,
and devote himself to the liberal arts. He
not only wrote and published the deservedly
famous “Reply” to Charles Sumner, which
was afterward reprinted in pamphlet form for
the benefit of his friends and admirers, but
he collected his fugitive verses in a volume,
which was published by an enterprising New
York firm “for the author;” and in addition
to this he became the proprietor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
editor of the Rockville “Vade-Mecum,” a
weekly paper devoted to “literature, science,
politics, and the news.”</p>

<p>When, therefore, the collapse came, the
colonel found himself practically stranded.
He was not only land-poor, but he had no
experience in the management of his plantation.
Ananias, when he returned from his
jaunt with the army, was of some help, but
not much. He knew how the plantation
ought to be managed, but he stood in awe
of the colonel, and he was somewhat backward
in giving his advice. In fact, he had
nothing to say unless his opinion was asked,
and this was not often, for Colonel Flewellen
had come to entertain the general opinion
about Ananias, which was, in effect, that he
was a sneaking, hypocritical rascal who was
not to be depended on; a good-enough
worker, to be sure, but not a negro in whom
one could repose confidence.</p>

<p>The truth is, Ananias’s appearance was
against him. He was ugly and mean-looking,
and he had a habit of slipping around
and keeping out of the way of white people—a
habit which, in that day and time, gave
everybody reason enough to distrust him.
As a result of this, Ananias got the credit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of every mean act that could not be traced
to any responsible source. If a smoke-house
was broken open in the night, Ananias
was the thief. The finger of suspicion was
pointed at him on every possible occasion.
He was thought to be the head and front of
the Union League, a political organization
set in motion by the shifty carpet-baggers for
the purpose of consolidating the negro vote
against the whites. In this way prejudice
deepened against him all the while, until he
finally became something of an Ishmaelite,
holding no intercourse with any white people
but Colonel Flewellen and Miss Nelly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as may be supposed, Colonel
Flewellen was not making much of a success
in managing his plantation. Beginning
without money, he had as much as
he could do to make “buckle and tongue
meet,” as the phrase goes. In fact he did
not make them meet. He farmed on the
old lavish plan. He borrowed money, and
he bought provisions, mules, and fertilizers
on credit, paying as much as two hundred
per cent interest on his debts.</p>

<p>Strange to say, his chief creditor was Mr.
Washington Jones, his former overseer.
Somehow or other Mr. Jones had thrived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
He had saved money as an overseer, being a
man of simple tastes and habits, and when
the crash came he was comparatively a rich
man. When affairs settled down somewhat,
Mr. Jones blossomed out as a commission
merchant, and he soon established a large
and profitable business. He sold provisions
and commercial fertilizers, he bought cotton,
and he was not above any transaction, however
small, that promised to bring him a
dime where he had invested a thrip. He
was a very thrifty man indeed. In addition
to his other business he shaved notes and
bought mortgages, and in this way the fact
came to be recognized, as early as 1868, that
he was what is known as “a leading citizen.”
He did not hesitate to grind a man when he
had him in his clutches, and on this account
he made enemies; but as his worldly possessions
grew and assumed tangible proportions,
it is not to be denied that he had
more friends than enemies.</p>

<p>For a while Mr. Washington Jones’s most
prominent patron was Colonel Benjamin
Flewellen. The colonel, it should be said,
was not only a patron of Jones, but he patronized
him. He made his purchases,
chiefly on credit, in a lordly, superior way,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
as became a gentleman whose hireling Jones
had been. When the colonel had money he
was glad to pay cash for his supplies, but
it happened somehow that he rarely had
money. Jones, it must be confessed, was
very accommodating. He was anxious to
sell to the colonel on the easiest terms, so
far as payment was concerned, and he often,
in a sly way, flattered the colonel into making
larger bills than he otherwise would
have made.</p>

<p>There could be but one result, and though
that result was inevitable, everybody about
Rockville seemed to be surprised. The colonel
had disposed of his newspaper long before,
and one day there appeared, in the columns
which he had once edited with such
care, a legal notice to the effect that he had
applied to the ordinary of the county, in
proper form, to set aside a homestead and
personalty. This meant that the colonel,
with his old-fashioned ways and methods,
had succumbed to the inevitable. He had a
house and lot in town, and this was set apart
as his homestead by the judge of ordinary.
Mr. Washington Jones, you may be sure,
lost no time in foreclosing his mortgages,
and the fact soon came to be known that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
was now the proprietor of the Flewellen
place.</p>

<p>Just at this point the colonel first began
to face the real problems of life, and he
found them to be very knotty ones. He
must live—but how? He knew no law,
and was acquainted with no business. He
was a gentleman and a scholar; but these
accomplishments would not serve him; indeed,
they stood in his way. He had been
brought up to no business, and it was a little
late in life—the colonel was fifty or more—to
begin to learn. He might have entered
upon a political career, and this would
have been greatly to his taste, but all the
local offices were filled by competent men,
and just at that time a Southerner to the
manner born had little chance to gain admission
to Congress. The Republican “reconstructionists,”
headed by Thaddeus Stevens,
barred the way. The outlook was
gloomy indeed.</p>

<p>Nelly Flewellen, who had grown to be a
beautiful woman, and who was as accomplished
as she was beautiful, gave music
lessons; but in Rockville at that time there
was not much to be made by teaching music.
It is due to the colonel to say that he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
bitterly opposed to this project, and he was
glad when his daughter gave it up in despair.
Then she took in sewing surreptitiously,
and did other things that a girl of
tact and common sense would be likely to
do when put to the test.</p>

<p>The colonel and his daughter managed to
get along somehow, but it was a miserable
existence compared to their former estate of
luxury. Just how they managed, only one
person in the wide world knew, and that person
was Ananias. Everybody around Rockville
said it was very queer how the colonel,
with no money and little credit, could afford
to keep a servant, and a man-servant at
that. But there was nothing queer about it.
Ananias received no wages of any sort; he
asked for none; he expected none. A child
of misfortune himself, he was glad to share
the misfortunes of his former master. He
washed, he ironed, he cooked, he milked,
and he did more. He found time to do
little odd jobs around town, and with the
money thus earned he was able to supply
things that would otherwise have been missing
from Colonel Flewellen’s table. He
was as ugly and as mean-looking as ever,
and as unpopular. Even the colonel distrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
him, but he managed to tolerate
him. The daughter often had words of
praise for the shabby and forlorn-looking
negro, and these, if anything, served to
lighten his tasks.</p>

<p>But in spite of everything that his daughter
or Ananias could do, the colonel continued
to grow poorer. To all appearances—and
he managed to keep up appearances
to the last—he was richer than many of
his neighbors, for he had a comfortable
house, and he still had credit in the town.
Among the shopkeepers there were few that
did not respect and admire the colonel for
what he had been. But the colonel, since
his experience with Mr. Washington Jones,
looked with suspicion on the credit business.
The result was that he and his daughter and
Ananias lived in the midst of the ghastliest
poverty.</p>

<p>As for Ananias, he could stand it well
enough; so, perhaps, could the colonel, he
being a man, and a pretty stout one; but
how about the young lady? This was the
question that Ananias was continually asking
himself, and circumstances finally drove
him to answering it in his own way. There
was this much to be said about Ananias;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
when he made up his mind, nothing could
turn him, humble as he was; and then came
a period in the career of the family to which
he had attached himself when he was compelled
to make up his mind or see them
starve.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>At this late day there is no particular
reason for concealing the facts. Ananias
took the responsibility on his shoulders, and
thereafter the colonel’s larder was always
comparatively full. At night Ananias would
sit and nod before a fire in the kitchen, and
after everybody else had gone to bed he
would sneak out into the darkness, and be
gone for many hours; but whether the hours
of his absence were many or few, he never
returned empty-handed. Sometimes he
would bring a “turn” of wood, sometimes
a bag of meal or potatoes, sometimes a side
of meat or a ham, and sometimes he would
be compelled to stop, while yet some distance
from the house, to choke a chicken
that betrayed a tendency to squall in the
small still hours between midnight and
morning. The colonel and his daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
never knew whence their supplies came.
They only knew that Ananias suddenly developed
into a wonderfully good cook, for it
is a very good cook indeed that can go on
month after month providing excellent meals
without calling for new supplies.</p>

<p>But Ananias had always been peculiar,
and if he grew a trifle more uncommunicative
than usual, neither the colonel nor the colonel’s
daughter was expected to take notice of
the fact. Ananias was a sullen negro at best,
but his sullenness was not at all important,
and nobody cared whether his demeanor was
grave or gay, lively or severe. Indeed, except
that he was an object of distrust and
suspicion, nobody cared anything at all about
Ananias. For his part, Ananias seemed to
care nothing for people’s opinions, good,
bad, or indifferent. If the citizens of Rockville
thought ill of him, that was their affair
altogether. Ananias went sneaking around,
attending to what he conceived to be his
own business, and there is no doubt that, in
some way, he managed to keep Colonel Flewellen’s
larder well supplied with provisions.</p>

<p>About this time Mr. Washington Jones,
who had hired a clerk for his store, and who
was mainly devoting his time to managing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
as proprietor, the Flewellen place, which he
had formerly managed as overseer, began to
discover that he was the victim of a series
of mysterious robberies and burglaries. Nobody
suffered but Mr. Jones, and everybody
said that it was not only very unjust, but
very provoking also, that this enterprising
citizen should be systematically robbed,
while all his neighbors should escape. These
mysterious robberies soon became the talk
of the whole county. Some people sympathized
with Jones, while others laughed at
him. Certainly the mystery was a very
funny mystery, for when Jones watched his
potato hill, his smoke-house was sure to be
entered. If he watched his smoke-house,
his potato hill would suffer. If he divided
his time watching both of these, his storehouse
would be robbed. There was no regularity
about this; but it was generally conceded
that the more Jones watched, the
more he was robbed, and it finally came to
be believed in the county that Jones, to express
it in the vernacular, “hollered too
loud to be hurt much.”</p>

<p>At last one day it was announced that
Jones had discovered the thief who had been
robbing him. He had not caught him, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
he had seen him plainly enough to identify
him. The next thing that Rockville knew,
a warrant had been issued for Ananias, and
he was arrested. He had no commitment
trial. He was lodged in the jail to await
trial in the Superior Court. Colonel Flewellen
was sorry for the negro, as well he
might be, but he was afraid to go on his
bond. Faithful as Ananias had been, he
was a negro, after all, the colonel argued,
and if he was released on bond he would not
hesitate to run away, if such an idea should
occur to him.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Ananias, he was not permitted
to languish in jail. The Superior
Court met the week after he was arrested,
and his case was among the first called. It
seemed to be a case, indeed, that needed
very little trying. But a very curious incident
happened in the court-room.</p>

<p>Among the lawyers present was Mr. Terrell,
of Macon. Mr. Terrell was by all
odds the greatest lawyer practising in that
circuit. He was so great, indeed, that he
was not called “major,” or “colonel,” or
“judge.” He ranked with Stephens and
Hill, and like these distinguished men his
title was plain “Mr.” Mr. Terrell practised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
in all the judicial circuits of the State, and
had important cases in all of them. He
was in Rockville for the purpose of arguing
a case to be tried at term, and which he
knew would be carried to the Supreme
Court of the State, no matter what the verdict
of the lower court might be. He was
arranging and verifying his authorities anew,
and he was very busy when the sheriff came
into the court-house bringing Ananias. The
judge on the bench thought he had never
seen a more rascally-looking prisoner; but
even rascally-looking prisoners have their
rights, and so, when Ananias’s case was
called, the judge asked him in a friendly
way if he had counsel—if he had engaged
a lawyer to defend him.</p>

<p>Ananias did not understand at first, but
when the matter was made plain to him he
said he could get a lawyer. Whereupon he
walked over to where Mr. Terrell sat immersed
in his big books, and touched him
on the shoulder. The lawyer looked up.</p>

<p>“I’m name’ Ananias, suh,” said the negro.</p>

<p>“I remember you,” said Mr. Terrell.
“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>“Dey got me up fer my trial, suh, en I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
’ain’t got nobody fer ter speak de word fer
me, suh, en I ’low’d maybe—”</p>

<p>Ananias paused. He knew not what else
to say. He had no sort of claim on this
man. He saw everybody around him laughing.
The great lawyer himself smiled as he
twirled his eye-glasses on his fingers. Ananias
was embarrassed.</p>

<p>“You want me to speak the word?” said
Mr. Terrell.</p>

<p>“Yes, suh, if you please, suh.”</p>

<p>“You need not trouble yourself, Mr. Terrell,”
said the judge, affably. “I was about
to appoint counsel.”</p>

<p>“May it please your honor,” said Mr.
Terrell, rising. “I will defend this boy.
I know nothing whatever of the case, but I
happen to know something of the negro.”</p>

<p>There was quite a little stir in the court-room
at this announcement. The loafers
outside the railings of the bar, who had
seen Ananias every day for a good many
years, leaned forward to take another look
at him. The lawyers inside the bar also
seemed to be interested in the matter. Some
thought that the great lawyer had taken the
negro’s case by way of a joke, and they
promised themselves a good deal of enjoyment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
for it is not every day that a prominent
man is seen at play. Others knew not
what to think; so that between those who regarded
it as a practical joke and those who
thought that Mr. Terrell might be in a serious
mood, the affair caused quite a sensation.</p>

<p>“May it please the court,” said Mr. Terrell,
his firm voice penetrating to every
part of the large room, “I know nothing of
this case; therefore I will ask half an hour’s
delay to look over the papers and to consult
with my client.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said the judge, pleasantly.
“Mr. Sheriff, take the prisoner to the Grand
Jury room, so that he may consult with his
counsel.”</p>

<p>The sheriff locked the prisoner and the
lawyer in the Grand Jury room, and left his
deputy there to open the door when Mr.
Terrell announced that the conference was
over. In the mean time the court proceeded
with other business. Cases were settled,
dismissed, or postponed. A couple of young
lawyers fell into a tumultuous wrangle over
an immaterial point, which the judge disposed
of with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>In the Grand Jury room Ananias was
telling his volunteer counsel a strange tale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>“And do you mean to tell me that you
really stole these things from Jones?” said
Mr. Terrell, after he had talked a little with
his client.</p>

<p>“Well, suh,” replied Ananias, unabashed,
“I didn’t zackly steal um, suh, but I tuck
um; I des tuck um, suh.”</p>

<p>“What call had you to steal from Jones?
Weren’t you working for Colonel Flewellen?
Didn’t he feed you?” inquired the
lawyer. Ananias shifted about from one
foot to the other, and whipped his legs with
his shabby hat, which he held in his hand.
Lawyer Terrell, seated in a comfortable
chair, and thoroughly at his ease, regarded
the negro curiously. There appeared to be
a pathetic element even in Ananias’s manner.</p>

<p>“Well, suh,” he said, after a while, seeing
that he could not escape from the confession,
“ef I hadn’t a-tuck dem things fum
Marse Wash Jones, my Marster en my
young mistiss would ’a’ sot dar en bodaciously
starve deyse’f ter deff. I done seed
dat, suh. Dey wuz too proud ter tell folks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
dey wuz dat bad off, suh, en dey’d ’a sot dar,
en des bodaciously starve deyse’f ter deff,
suh. All dey lifetime, suh, dey bin use ter
havin’ deir vittles put right on de table whar
dey kin git it, en w’en de farmin’ days done
gone, suh, dey wa’n’t nobody but Ananias
fer put de vittles dar; en I des hatter scuffle
’roun’ en git it de bes’ way I kin. I ’spec’,
suh,” Ananias went on, his countenance
brightening up a little, “dat ef de wuss had
a-come ter de wuss, I’d ’a’ stole de vittles;
but I ’ain’t had ter steal it, suh; I des went
en tuck it fum Marse Wash Jones, kaze it
come off’n Marster’s lan’, suh.”</p>

<p>“Why, the land belongs to Jones,” said
Lawyer Terrell.</p>

<p>“Dat w’at dey say, suh; but eve’y foot
er dat lan’ b’longded ter de Flewellen fambly
long ’fo’ Marse Wash Jones’ daddy sot
up a hat-shop in de neighborhoods. I dunner
how Marse Wash git dat lan’, suh; I
know it b’longded in de Flewellen fambly
sence ’way back, en dey got deir graveyard
dar yit.”</p>

<p>Lawyer Terrell’s unusually stern face
softened a little. He saw that Ananias was
in earnest, and his sympathies were aroused.
He had some further conversation with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
negro, questioning him in regard to a great
many things that assumed importance in the
trial.</p>

<p>When Lawyer Terrell and his client returned
to the court-room they found it filled
with spectators. Somehow, it became generally
known that the great advocate was to
defend Ananias, and a large crowd of people
had assembled to watch developments.
In some way the progress of Ananias and
the deputy-sheriff through the crowd that
filled all the aisles and doorways had been
delayed; but when the negro, forlorn and
wretched-looking, made his appearance in
the bar for the purpose of taking a seat by
his counsel, there was a general laugh. Instantly
Lawyer Terrell was upon his feet.</p>

<p>“May it please your honor, what <em>is</em> the
duty of the sheriff of this county, if it is not
to keep order in this court-room?”</p>

<p>The ponderous staff of the sheriff came
down on the floor with a thump; but it was
unnecessary. Silence had fallen on the
spectators with the first words of the lawyer.
The crowd knew that he was a game man,
and they admired him for it. His whole
attitude, as he gazed at the people around
him, showed that he was full of fight. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
heavy blond hair, swept back from his high
forehead, looked like the mane of a lion,
and his steel-gray eyes glittered under his
shaggy and frowning brows.</p>

<p>The case of the State <i lang="la">versus</i> Ananias
Flewellen, <i lang="la">alias</i> Ananias Harper—a name
he had taken since freedom—was called in
due form. It was observed that Lawyer
Terrell was very particular to strike certain
names from the jury list, but this gave no
clue to the line of his defense. The first
witness was Mr. Washington Jones, who detailed,
as well as he knew how, the circumstances
of the various robberies of which
he had been the victim. He had suspected
Ananias, but had not made his suspicions
known until he was sure,—until he had
caught him stealing sweet-potatoes.</p>

<p>The cross-examination of the witness by
Ananias’s counsel was severe. The fact
was gradually developed that Mr. Jones
caught the negro stealing potatoes at night;
that the night was dark and cloudy; that
he did not actually catch the negro, but saw
him; that he did not really see the negro
clearly, but knew “in reason” that it must
be Ananias.</p>

<p>The fact was also developed that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Jones was not alone when he saw Ananias,
but was accompanied by Mr. Miles Cottingham,
a small farmer in the neighborhood,
who was well known all over the county as
a man of undoubted veracity and of the
strictest integrity.</p>

<p>At this point Lawyer Terrell, who had
been facing Mr. Jones with severity painted
on his countenance, seemed suddenly to recover
his temper. He turned to the listening
crowd, and said, in his blandest tones,
“Is Mr. Miles Cottingham in the room?”</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then a small boy
perched in one of the windows, through
which the sun was streaming, cried out,
“He’s a-standin’ out yander by the horse-rack.”</p>

<p>Whereupon a subpœna was promptly
made out by the clerk of the court, and the
deputy sheriff, putting his head out of a
window, cried:</p>

<p>“Miles G. Cottingham! Miles G. Cottingham!
Miles G. Cottingham! Come into
court.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cottingham was fat, rosy, and cheerful.
He came into court with such a dubious
smile on his face that his friends in
the room were disposed to laugh, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
remembered that Lawyer Terrell was somewhat
intolerant of these manifestations of
good-humor. As for Mr. Cottingham himself,
he was greatly puzzled. When the
voice of the court crier reached his ears he
was in the act of taking a dram, and, as he
said afterward, he “come mighty nigh drappin’
the tumbeler.” But he was not subjected
to any such mortification. He tossed
off his dram in fine style, and went to the
court-house, where, as soon as he had pushed
his way to the front, he was met by Lawyer
Terrell, who shook him heartily by the hand,
and told him his testimony was needed in
order that justice might be done.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Cottingham was put on the
stand as a witness for the defense.</p>

<p>“How old are you, Mr. Cottingham?”
said Lawyer Terrell.</p>

<p>“Ef I make no mistakes, I’m a-gwine on
sixty-nine,” replied the witness.</p>

<p>“Are your eyes good?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, they er about ez good ez the
common run; not so good ez they mought
be, en yit good enough fer me.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see that negro before?”
The lawyer pointed to Ananias.</p>

<p>“Which nigger? That un over there?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Why, that’s thish yer God-forsakin’ Ananias.
Ef it had a-bin any yuther nigger but
Ananias I wouldn’t ’a’ bin so certain and
shore; bekaze sence the war they er all so
mighty nigh alike I can’t tell one from
t’other sca’cely. All eckceppin’ of Ananias;
I’d know Ananias ef I met ’im in kingdom
come wi’ his hair all swinjed off.”</p>

<p>The jury betrayed symptoms of enjoying
this testimony; seeing which, the State’s attorney
rose to his feet to protest.</p>

<p>“May it please the court”—</p>

<p>“One moment, your honor!” exclaimed
Lawyer Terrell. Then, turning to the witness:
“Mr. Cottingham, were you with Mr.
Jones when he was watching to catch a thief
who had been stealing from him?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” replied Mr. Cottingham, “I
sot up wi’ him one night, but I disremember
in pertickler what night it wuz.”</p>

<p>“Did you see the thief?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said Mr. Cottingham, in his
deliberate way, looking around over the
court-room with a more judicial air than the
judge on the bench, “ef you push me close
I’ll tell you. Ther wuz a consid’able flutterment
in the neighborhoods er whar we sot,
an’ me an’ Wash done some mighty sly slippin’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
up en surrounderin’; but ez ter seein’
anybody, we didn’t see ’im. We heerd ’m
a-scufflin’ an’ a-runnin’, but we didn’t ketch
a glimpse un ’im, nuther har ner hide.”</p>

<p>“Did Mr. Jones see him?”</p>

<p>“No more’n I did. I wuz right at
Wash’s elbow. We heerd the villyun a-runnin’,
but we never seed ’im. Atterwards,
when we got back ter the house, Wash he
’lowed it must’a bin that nigger Ananias
thar, an’ I ’lowed it jess mought ez well be
Ananias ez any yuther nigger, bekaze you
know yourself—”</p>

<p>“That will do, Mr. Cottingham,” said
Mr. Lawyer Terrell, blandly. The State’s
attorney undertook to cross-examine Mr.
Cottingham; but he was a blundering man,
and the result of his cross-examination was
simply a stronger and more impressive repetition
of Mr. Cottingham’s testimony.</p>

<p>After this, the solicitor was willing to submit
the case to the jury without argument,
but Mr. Terrell said that if it pleased the
court he had a few words to say to the jury
in behalf of his client. The speech made
by the State’s attorney was flat and stale,
for he was not interested in the case; but
Lawyer Terrell’s appeal to the jury is still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
remembered in Rockville. It was not only
powerful, but inimitable; it was humorous,
pathetic, and eloquent. When he concluded,
the jury, which was composed mostly of
middle-aged men, was in tears. The feelings
of the spectators were also wrought up
to a very high pitch, and when the jury
found a verdict of “not guilty,” without retiring,
the people in the court-room made
the old house ring again with applause.</p>

<p>And then something else occurred. Pressing
forward through the crowd came Colonel
Benjamin Flewellen. His clothes were
a trifle shabby, but he had the air of a
prince of the blood. His long white hair
fell on his shoulders, and his movements
were as precise as those of a grenadier. The
spectators made way for him. Those nearest
noticed that his eyes were moist, and
that his nether lip was a-tremble, but no
one made any remark. Colonel Flewellen
pressed forward until he reached Ananias,
who, scarcely comprehending the situation,
was sitting with his hands folded and his
head bent down. The colonel placed his
hand on the negro’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Come, boy,” he said, “let’s go home.”</p>

<p>“Me, Marster?” said the negro, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
up with a dazed expression. It was the
tone, and not the words, that Ananias heard.</p>

<p>“Yes, old fellow, your Miss Nelly will be
waiting for us.”</p>

<p>“Name er God!” exclaimed Ananias,
and then he arose and followed his old
master out of the court-room. Those who
watched him as he went saw that the tears
were streaming down his face, but there was
no rude laughter when he made a futile attempt
to wipe them off with his coat-tail.
This display of feeling on the part of the
negro was somewhat surprising to those who
witnessed it, but nobody was surprised when
Ananias appeared on the streets a few days
after with head erect and happiness in his
face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="WHERES_DUNCAN">WHERE’S DUNCAN?</h2>

<p>Now, do you know you young people are
mighty queer? Somebody has told you that
he heard old man Isaiah Winchell a-gabbling
about old times, and here you come
fishing for what you call a story. Why,
bless your soul, man, it is no story at all,
just a happening, as my wife used to say.
If you want me to tell what there is of it,
there must be some understanding about it.
You know what ought to be put in print
and what ought to be left out. I would
know myself, I reckon, if I stopped to think
it all over; but there’s the trouble. When
I get started, I just rattle along like a runaway
horse. I’m all motion and no sense,
and there’s no stopping me until I run over
a stump or up against a fence. And if I
tried to write it out, it would be pretty much
the same. When I take a pen in my hand
my mind takes all sorts of uncertain flights,
like a pigeon with a hawk after it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the affair you were speaking of,
there’s not much to tell, but it has pestered
me at times when I ought to have been in
my bed and sound asleep. I have told it a
thousand times, and the rest of the Winchells
have told it, thinking it was a very
good thing to have in the family. It has
been exaggerated, too; but if I can carry
the facts to your ear just as they are in my
mind, I shall be glad, for I want to get
everything straight from the beginning.</p>

<p>Well, it was in 1826. That seems a long
time ago to you, but it is no longer than
yesterday to me. I was eighteen years old,
and a right smart chunk of a boy for my
age. While we were ginning and packing
cotton our overseer left us, and my father
turned the whole business over to me. Now,
you may think that was a small thing, because
this railroad business has turned your
head, but, as a matter of fact, it was a very
big thing. It fell to me to superintend the
ginning and the packing of the cotton, and
then I was to go to Augusta in charge of
two wagons. I never worked harder before
nor since. You see we had no packing-screws
nor cotton-presses in those days.
The planter that was able to afford it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
his gin, and the cotton was packed in round
bales by a nigger who used something like a
crowbar to do the packing. He trampled
the lint cotton with his feet, and beat it
down with his iron bar until the bagging
was full, and then the bale weighed about
three hundred pounds. Naturally you laugh
at this sort of thing, but it was no laughing
matter; it was hard work.</p>

<p>Well, when we got the cotton all prepared,
we loaded the wagons and started for
Augusta. We hadn’t got more than two
miles from home, before I found that
Crooked-leg Jake, my best driver, was
drunk. He was beastly drunk. Where he
got his dram, I couldn’t tell you to save my
life, for it was against the law in those days
to sell whiskey to a nigger. But Crooked-leg
Jake had it and he was full of it, and he
had to be pulled off of the mule and sent to
roost on top of the cotton-bags. It was not
a very warm roost either, but it was warm
enough for a nigger full of whiskey.</p>

<p>This was not a good thing for me at all,
but I had to make the best of it. Moreover,
I had to do what I had never done before—I
had to drive six mules, and there
was only one rein to drive them with. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was the fashion, but it was a very difficult
matter for a youngster to get the hang of it.
You jerk, jerk, jerked, if you wanted the
lead mule to turn to the right, and you pull,
pull, pulled if you wanted her to go the left.
While we were going on in this way, with
a stubborn mule at the wheel and a drunken
nigger on the wagon, suddenly there came
out of the woods a thick-set, dark-featured,
black-bearded man with a bag slung across
his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Hello!” says he; “you must be a new
hand.”</p>

<p>“It would take a very old hand,” said I,
“to train a team of mules to meet you in
the road.”</p>

<p>“Now, there you have me,” said he; and
he laughed as if he were enjoying a very
good joke.</p>

<p>“Who hitched up your team?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That drunken nigger,” said I.</p>

<p>“To be sure,” said he; “I might have
known it. The lead-mule is on the off
side.”</p>

<p>“Why, how do you know that?” I asked.</p>

<p>“My two eyes tell me,” he replied;
“they are pulling crossways.” And with
that, without asking anybody’s permission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
he unhitched the traces, unbuckled the reins
and changed the places of the two front
mules. It was all done in a jiffy, and in
such a light-hearted manner that no protest
could be made; and, indeed, no protest was
necessary, for the moment the team started
I could see that the stranger was right.
There was no more jerking and whipping to
be done. We went on in this way for a
mile or more, when suddenly I thought to
ask the stranger, who was trudging along
good-humoredly by the side of the wagon, if
he would like to ride. He laughed and said
he wouldn’t mind it if I would let him
straddle the saddle-mule; and for my part I
had no objections.</p>

<p>So I crawled up on the cotton and lay
there with Crooked-leg Jake. I had been
there only a short time when the nigger
awoke and saw me. He looked scared.</p>

<p>“Who dat drivin’ dem mules, Marse
Isaiah?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t tell you even if you were
sober,” said I. “The lead-mule was hitched
on the off-side, and the man that is driving
rushed out of the woods, fixed her right, and
since then we have been making good time.”</p>

<p>“Is he a sho’ ’nuff w’ite man, Marse
Isaiah?” asked Jake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, he looks like he is,” said I; “but
I’m not certain about that.”</p>

<p>With that Jake crawled to the front of
the wagon, and looked over at the driver.
After a while he came crawling back.</p>

<p>“Tell me what you saw,” said I.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said he, “I dunner whe’er
dat man’s a w’ite man or not, but he’s a-settin’
sideways on dat saddle-mule, en every
time he chirps, dat lead-mule know what he
talkin’ about. Yasser. She do dat. Did
you say he come outen de woods?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where he came from,” said
I. “He’s there, and he’s driving the
mules.”</p>

<p>“Yasser. Dat’s so. He’s dar sho’, kaze
I seed ’im wid my own eyes. He look like
he made outen flesh en blood, en yit he
mought be a ha’nt; dey ain’t no tellin’.
Dem dar mules is gwine on mos’ too slick
fer ter suit me.”</p>

<p>Well, the upshot of it was that the
stranger continued to drive. He made himself
useful during the day, and when night
came, he made himself musical; for in the
pack slung across his back was a fiddle, and
in the manipulation of this instrument he
showed a power and a mastery which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
given to few men to possess. I doubt
whether he would have made much of a
show on the stage, but I have heard some of
your modern players, and none of them
could approach him, according to my taste.
I’ll tell you why. They all seem to play
the music for the music itself, but this man
played it for the sake of what it reminded
him of. I remember that when he took out
his fiddle at night, as he invariably did if
nobody asked him to, I used to shut my
eyes and dream dreams that I have never
dreamed since, and see visions that are
given to few men to see. If I were younger
I could describe it to you, but an old man
like me is not apt at such descriptions.</p>

<p>We journeyed on, and, as we journeyed,
we were joined by other wagons hauling
cotton, until, at last, there was quite a caravan
of them—twenty, at least, and possibly
more. This made matters very lively,
as you may suppose, especially at night,
when we went into camp. Then there were
scenes such as have never been described in
any of the books that profess to tell about
life in the South before the war. After
the teams had been fed and supper cooked,
the niggers would sing, dance and wrestle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and the white men would gather to egg them
on, or sit by their fires and tell stories or
play cards. Sometimes there would be a
fight, and that was exciting; for in those
days, the shotgun was mighty handy and the
dirk was usually within reach. In fact,
there was every amusement that such a
crowd of people could manage to squeeze out
of such an occasion. In our caravan there
were more than a dozen fiddlers, white and
black, but not one of them that attracted as
much attention as the stranger who drove
my team. When he was in the humor he
could entrance the whole camp; but it was
not often that he would play, and it frequently
happened that he and I would go to
bed under our wagon while the rest of the
teamsters were frolicking. I had discovered
that he was a good man to have along. He
knew just how to handle the mules, he knew
all the roads, he knew just where to camp,
and he knew how to keep Crooked-leg Jake
sober. One night after we had gone to bed
he raised himself on his elbow and said:</p>

<p>“To-morrow night, if I make no mistake,
we will camp within a few miles of the
Sandhills. There my journey ends, and yet
you have never asked me my name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “you are a much older
man than I am, and I had a notion that if
you wanted me to know your name you
would tell me. I had no more reason for
asking it than you have for hiding it.”</p>

<p>He lay over on his back and laughed.</p>

<p>“You’ll find out better than that when
you are older,” he said, and then he continued
laughing—though whether it was
what I said or his own thoughts that tickled
him, I had no means of knowing.</p>

<p>“Well,” he went on, after a while, “you
are as clever a youngster as ever I met, and
I’ve nothing to hide from you. My name
is Willis Featherstone, and I am simply a
vagabond, else you would never have seen
me trudging along the public road with only
a fiddle at my back; but I have a rich
daddy hereabouts, and I’m on my way to
see how he is getting along. Now,” he continued,
“I’ll give you a riddle. If you can’t
unriddle it, it will unriddle itself. A father
had a son. He sent him to school in Augusta,
until he was fifteen. By that time,
the father grew to hate the son, and one
day, in a fit of anger, sold him to a nigger
speculator.”</p>

<p>“How could that be?” I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is a part of the riddle,” said he.</p>

<p>“Are you the son?”</p>

<p>“That is another part of the same riddle.”</p>

<p>“Where was the son’s mother?” I asked.</p>

<p>“In the riddle—in the riddle,” he replied.</p>

<p>I could not unriddle the riddle, but it
seemed to hint at some such villainy as I
had read about in the books in my father’s
library. Here was a man who had sold his
son; that was enough for me. It gave me
matter to dream on, and as I was a pretty
heavy feeder in those days, my dreams followed
hard on each other. But it isn’t
worth while to relate them here, for the
things that actually happened were infinitely
worse than any dream could be.</p>

<p>As Featherstone had foretold, we camped
the next night not far from the Sandhills,
where the rich people of Augusta went
every summer to escape the heat and malaria
of the city. We might have gone on and
reached Augusta during the night, but both
men and mules were tired, and of the entire
caravan only one wagon went forward. I
shall remember the place as long as I live.
In a little hollow, surrounded by live-oaks—we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
call them water-oaks up here—was a
very bold spring, and around and about was
plenty of grass for the mules. It was somewhat
dry, the time being November, but it
made excellent forage. On a little hill beyond
the spring was a dwelling-house. I
came to have a pretty good view of it afterward,
but in the twilight it seemed to be a
very substantial building. It was painted
white and had green blinds, and it sat in
the midst of a beautiful grove of magnolias
and cedars. I remember, too,—it is all
impressed on my mind so vividly—that the
avenue leading to the house was lined on
each side with Lombardy poplars, and their
spindling trunks stood clearly out against
the sky.</p>

<p>While I was helping Featherstone unhitch
and unharness the mules, he suddenly
remarked:—</p>

<p>“That’s the place.”</p>

<p>“What place?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The place the riddle tells about—where
the son was sold by his father.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, by way of saying something,
“what can’t be cured must be endured.”</p>

<p>“You are a very clever chap,” he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
after a while. “In fact you are the best
chap I have seen for many a long day, and
I like you. I’ve watched you like a hawk,
and I know you have a mother at home.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said I, “and she’s the dearest old
mother you ever saw. I wish you knew
her.”</p>

<p>He came up to me, laid his hand on my
shoulder, and looked into my face with an
air I can never forget.</p>

<p>“That is the trouble,” said he; “I don’t
know her. If I did I would be a better
man. I never had much of a mother.”</p>

<p>With that he turned away, and soon I
heard him singing softly to himself as he
mended a piece of the harness. All this
time Crooked-leg Jake was cooking our supper
beneath the live-oak trees. Other teamsters
were doing the same, so that there
were two dozen camp-fires burning brightly
within an area of not more than a quarter
of a mile. The weather was pleasant, too,
and the whole scene struck me as particularly
lively.</p>

<p>Crooked-leg Jake was always free-handed
with his cooking. He went at it with a
zest born of his own insatiate appetite, and
it was not long before we were through with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
it; and while the other campers were fuming
and stewing over their cooking, Jake
was sitting by the fire nodding, and Featherstone
was playing his fiddle. He never
played it better than he did that night, and
he played it a long time, while I sat listening.
Meanwhile quite a number of the
teamsters gathered around, some reclining in
the leaves smoking their pipes, and others
standing around in various positions. Suddenly
I discovered that Featherstone had a
new and an unexpected auditor. Just how
I discovered this I do not know; it must
have been proned in upon me, as the niggers
say. I observed that he gripped the neck of
his fiddle a little tighter, and suddenly he
swung off from “Money-musk” into one of
those queer serenades which you have heard
now and again on the plantation. Where
the niggers ever picked up such tunes the
Lord only knows, but they are heart-breaking
ones.</p>

<p>Following the glance of Featherstone’s
eyes, I looked around, and I saw, standing
within the circle of teamsters, a tall mulatto
woman. She was a striking figure as she
stood there gazing with all her eyes, and
listening with all her ears. Her hair was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
black and straight as that of an Indian, her
cheeks were sunken, and there was that in
her countenance that gave her a wolfish aspect.
As she stood there rubbing her skinny
hands together and moistening her thin lips
with her tongue, she looked like one distraught.
When Featherstone stopped playing,
pretending to be tuning his fiddle, the
mulatto woman drew a long breath, and
made an effort to smile. Her thin lips fell
apart and her white teeth gleamed in the
firelight like so many fangs. Finally she
spoke, and it was an ungracious speech:—</p>

<p>“Ole Giles Featherstone, up yonder—he’s
my marster—he sont me down here
an’ tole me to tell you-all dat, bein’s he got
some vittles lef’ over fum dinner, he’ll be
glad ef some un you would come take supper
’long wid ’im. But, gentermens”—here
she lowered her voice, giving it a most
tragic tone—“you better not go, kaze he
ain’t got nothin’ up dar dat’s fittin’ ter eat—some
cole scraps an’ de frame uv a turkey.
He scrimps hisse’f, an’ he scrimps
me, an’ he scrimps eve’ybody on de place,
an’ he’ll scrimp you-all ef you go dar. No,
gentermens, ef you des got corn-bread an’
bacon you better stay ’way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever response the teamsters might
have made was drowned by Featherstone’s
fiddle, which plunged suddenly into the
wild and plaintive strains of a plantation
melody. The mulatto woman stood like
one entranced; she caught her breath, drew
back a few steps, stretched forth her ebony
arms, and cried out:—</p>

<p>“Who de name er God is dat man?”</p>

<p>With that Featherstone stopped his playing,
fixed his eyes on the woman, and exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“<em>Where’s Duncan?</em>”</p>

<p>For a moment the woman stood like one
paralyzed. She gasped for breath, her
arms jerked convulsively, and there was a
twitching of the muscles of her face pitiful
to behold; then she rushed forward and fell
on her knees at the fiddler’s feet, hugging
his legs with her arms.</p>

<p>“Honey, who is you?” she cried in a
loud voice. “In de name er de Lord, who
is you! Does you know me? Say, honey,
does you?”</p>

<p>Featherstone looked at the writhing woman
serenely.</p>

<p>“Come, now,” he said, “I ask you once
more, <em>Where’s Duncan?</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>His tone was most peculiar: it was thrilling,
indeed, and it had a tremendous effect
on the woman. She rose to her feet, flung
her bony arms above her head, and ran off
into the darkness, screaming:—</p>

<p>“He sold ’im!—he sold Duncan! He
sold my onliest boy!”</p>

<p>This she kept on repeating as she ran,
and her voice died away like an echo in the
direction of the house on the hill. There
was not much joking among the teamsters
over this episode, and somehow there was
very little talk of any kind. None of us accepted
the invitation. Featherstone put his
fiddle in his bag, and walked off toward the
wagons, and it was not long before everybody
had turned in for the night.</p>

<p>I suppose I had been asleep an hour when
I felt some one shaking me by the shoulder.
It was Crooked-leg Jake.</p>

<p>“Marse Isaiah,” said he, “dey er cuttin’
up a mighty rippit up dar at dat house on de
hill. I ’spec’ somebody better go up dar.”</p>

<p>“What are they doing?” I asked him
drowsily.</p>

<p>“Dey er cussin’ an’ gwine on scan’lous.
Dat ar nigger ’oman, she’s a-cussin’ out de
white man, an’ de white man, he’s a-cussin’
back at her.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>“Where’s Featherstone?” I inquired,
still not more than half awake.</p>

<p>“Dat what make me come atter you, suh.
Dat white man what bin ’long wid us, he’s
up dar, an’ it look like ter me dat he’s a-aggin’
de fuss on. Dey gwine ter be
trouble up dar, sho ez you er born.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” said I, “the woman’s master
will call her up, give her a strapping, and
that will be the end of it.”</p>

<p>“No, suh! no, suh!” exclaimed Jake;
“dat ar nigger ’oman done got dat white
man hacked. Hit’s des like I tell you,
mon!”</p>

<p>I drove Jake off to bed, turned over on
my pallet, and was about to go to sleep
again, when I heard quite a stir in the camp.
The mules and horses were snorting and tugging
at their halters, the chickens on the
hill were cackling, and somewhere near, a
flock of geese was screaming. Just then
Crooked-leg Jake came and shook me by
the shoulder again. I spoke to him somewhat
sharply, but he didn’t seem to mind
it.</p>

<p>“What I tell you, Marse Isaiah?” he
cried. “Look up yonder! Ef dat house
ain’t afire on top, den Jake’s a liar!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>I turned on my elbow, and, sure enough,
the house on the hill was outlined in flame.
The hungry, yellow tongues of fire reached
up the corners and ran along the roof, lapping
the shingles, here and there, as if blindly
searching for food. They found it, too, for
by the time I reached the spot, and you
may be sure I was not long getting there, the
whole roof was in a blaze. I had never seen
a house on fire before, and the sight of it
made me quake; but in a moment I had forgotten
all about the fire, for there, right before
my eyes, was a spectacle that will haunt
me to my dying day. In the dining-room—I
suppose it must have been the dining-room,
for there was a sideboard with a row of candles
on it—I saw the mulatto woman (the
same that had acted so queerly when Featherstone
had asked her about Duncan) engaged
in an encounter with a gray-haired white
man. The candles on the sideboard and the
flaring flames without lit up the affair until it
looked like some of the spectacles I have since
seen in theatres, only it was more terrible.</p>

<p>It was plain that the old man was no
match for the woman, but he fought manfully
for his life. Whatever noise they made
must have been drowned by the crackling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and roaring of the flames outside; but they
seemed to be making none except a snarling
sound when they caught their breath, like
two bull-dogs fighting. The woman had a
carving-knife in her right hand, and she was
endeavoring to push the white man against
the wall. He, on his side, was trying to
catch and hold the hand in which the woman
held the knife, and was also making a frantic
effort to keep away from the wall. But
the woman had the advantage; she was
younger and stronger, and desperate as he
was, she was more desperate still.</p>

<p>Of course, it is a very easy matter to
ask why some of my companions or myself
didn’t rush to the rescue. I think such an
attempt was made; but the roof of the
house was ablaze and crackling from one end
to the other, and the heat and smoke were
stifling. The smoke and flames, instead of
springing upward, ranged downward, so that
before anything could be done, the building
appeared to be a solid sheet of fire; but
through it all could be seen the writhing and
wrestling of the nigger woman and the white
man. Once, and only once, did I catch the
sound of a voice; it was the voice of the nigger
woman; she had her carving-knife raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
in the air in one hand, and with the other
she had the white man by the throat.</p>

<p>“<em>Where’s Duncan?</em>” she shrieked.</p>

<p>If the man had been disposed to reply, he
had no opportunity, for the woman had no
sooner asked the question than she plunged
the carving-knife into his body, not only once,
but twice. It was a sickening sight, indeed,
and I closed my eyes to avoid seeing any
more of it; but there was no need of that,
for the writhing and struggling bodies of the
two fell to the floor and so disappeared from
sight.</p>

<p>Immediately afterward there was a tremendous
crash. The roof had fallen in, and
this was followed by an eruption of sparks
and smoke and flame, accompanied by a
violent roaring noise that sounded like the
culmination of a storm. It was so loud that
it aroused the pigeons on the place, and a
great flock of them began circling around
the burning building. Occasionally one more
frightened than the rest would dart headlong
into the flames, and it was curious to
see the way it disappeared. There would
be a fizz and a sputter, and the poor bird
would be burnt harder than a crackling. I
observed this and other commonplace things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
with unusual interest—an interest sharpened,
perhaps, by the fact that there could
be no hope for the two human beings on
whom the roof had fallen.</p>

<p>Naturally, you will want to ask me a great
many questions. I have asked them myself
a thousand times, and I’ve tried to dream
the answers to them while I sat dozing here
in the sun, but when I dream about the affair
at all, the fumes of burning flesh seem
to fill my nostrils. Crooked-leg Jake insisted
to the day of his death that the man
who had driven our team sat in a chair
in the corner of the dining-room, while the
woman and the man were fighting, and
seemed to be enjoying the spectacle. It
may be so. At any rate none of us ever
saw him again. As for the rest, you know
just as much about it as I do.</p>

<h2 id="MOM_BI">MOM BI:<br />
<span class="smaller">HER FRIENDS AND HER ENEMIES.</span></h2>

<p>The little town of Fairleigh, in South
Carolina, was a noted place before the
war, whatever it may be now. It had its
atmosphere, as Judge Waynecroft used to
say, and that atmosphere was one of distinction.
It was a very quiet town, but there
was something aristocratic, something exclusive,
even in its repose. It was a rough
wind that could disturb the stateliness of
the live oaks with which the streets were
lined, and it was indeed an inhospitable
winter that could suppress the tendency of
the roses to bloom.</p>

<p>Fairleigh made no public boast that it
was not a commercial town, but there can
be no doubt that it prided itself on the fact.
Even the piney-woods crackers found a slow
market there for the little “truck” they had
to sell, for it was the custom of the people
to get their supplies of all kinds from “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
city.” It was to “the city,” indeed, that
Fairleigh owed its prominence, and its inhabitants
were duly mindful of that fact.</p>

<p>As late as 1854 there was no more insignificant
village in South Carolina than Fairleigh;
but in the summer of that year the
fever plague flapped its yellow wings above
Charleston, and the wealthier families
sought safety in flight. Some went North
and some went West; some went one way
and some another; but the choice few, following
the example of Judge Waynecroft,
went no further than Fairleigh, which was
far enough in the interior to be out of reach
of the contagion.</p>

<p>They found the situation of the little village
so convenient, and its climate so perfect,
that they proceeded—still following
the example of Judge Waynecroft—to build
summer homes there; and in time Fairleigh
became noted as a resort for the wealthiest
and most refined people of Charleston.</p>

<p>Of this movement, as has been intimated,
Judge Waynecroft was the pioneer;
and for this and other reasons he was highly
esteemed by the natives of Fairleigh. To
their minds the Judge was an able and a
public-spirited citizen, whom it was their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
pleasure to admire. In addition to this, he
had a most charming household, in which
simplicity lent grace to dignity.</p>

<p>There was one feature of Judge Waynecroft’s
household, however, which the natives
of Fairleigh did not admire, and that was
“Mom Bi.” Perhaps they were justified
in this. Mom Bi was a negro woman, who
appeared to be somewhat past middle age,
just how far past no one could guess. She
was tall and gaunt, and her skin was black
as jet. She walked rapidly, but with a sidewise
motion, as if she had been overtaken
with rheumatism or partial paralysis. Her
left arm was bent and withered, and she
carried it in front of her and across her
body, as one would hold an infant. Her
head-handkerchief was queerly tied. The
folds of it stood straight up in the air, giving
her the appearance of a black Amazon.
This impression was heightened by the peculiar
brightness of her eyes. They were
not large eyes, but they shone like those
of a wild animal that is not afraid of the
hunter. Her nose was not flat, nor were her
lips thick like those of the typical negro.
Her whole appearance was aggressive.
Moreover, her manner was abrupt, and her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
tongue sharp, especially when it was leveled
at any of the natives of Fairleigh.</p>

<p>To do Mom Bi justice, her manner was
abrupt and her tongue sharp even in her
master’s family, but there these matters
were understood. Practically, she ruled
the household, and though she quarreled
from morning till night, and sometimes far
into the night, everything she said was
taken in a Pickwickian sense. She was an
old family servant who not only had large
privileges, but was defiantly anxious to take
advantage of all of them.</p>

<p>Whatever effect slavery may have had on
other negroes, or on negroes in general, it
is certain that Mom Bi’s spirit remained
unbroken. Whoever crossed her in the
least, white or black, old or young, got “a
piece of her mind,” and it was usually a
very large piece. Naturally enough, under
the circumstances, Mom Bi soon became as
well known in Fairleigh and in all the region
round about as any of the “quality
people.” To some, her characteristics were
intensely irritating; while to others they
were simply amusing; but to all she was a
unique figure, superior in her methods and
ideas to the common run of negroes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>Once, after having a quarrel with her
mistress—a quarrel which was a one-sided
affair, however—Mom Bi heard one of the
house girls making an effort to follow her
example. The girl was making some impertinent
remarks to her mistress, when
Mom Bi seized a dog-whip that was hanging
in the hall, and used it with such effect that
the pert young wench remembered it for
many a long day.</p>

<p>This was Mom Bi’s way. She was ready
enough to quarrel with each and every member
of her master’s family, but she was
ready to defend the entire household against
any and all comers. Altogether she was a
queer combination of tyrant and servant, of
virago and “mammy.” Yet her master
and mistress appreciated and respected her,
and the children loved her. Her strong
individuality was not misunderstood by
those who knew her best.</p>

<p>No one knew just how old she was, and
no one knew her real name. Probably no
one cared: but there was a tradition in the
Waynecroft family that her name was Viola,
and that it had been corrupted by the children
into Bi—Mom Bi. As to her age, it
is sufficient to say that she was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
self-constituted repository of the oral history of
three generations of the family. She was a
young woman when her master’s grandfather
died in 1799. Good, bad or indifferent,
Mom Bi knew all about the family; and
there were passages in the careers of some
of its members that she was fond of retailing
to her master and mistress, especially
when in a bad humor.</p>

<p>Insignificant as she was, Mom Bi made
her influence felt in Fairleigh. She was respected
in her master’s family for her honesty
and faithfulness, but outsiders shrank
from her frank and fearless criticism. The
“sandhillers”—the tackies—that marketed
their poor little crops in and around
the village, were the special objects of her
aversion, and she lost no opportunity of
harassing them. Whether these queer people
regarded Mom Bi as a humorist of the
grimmer sort, or whether they were indifferent
to her opinions, it would be difficult to
say, but it is certain that her remarks, no
matter how personal or bitter, made little
impression on them. The men would rub
their thin beards, nudge each other and
laugh silently, while the women would push
their sunbonnets back and stare at her as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
she were some rare curiosity on exhibition.
At such times Mom Bi would laugh loudly
and maliciously, and cry out in a shrill and
an irritating tone:—</p>

<p>“De Lord know, I glad I nigger. Ef I
ain’t bin born black, dee ain’t no tellin, what
I mought bin born. I mought bin born lak
some deze white folks what eat dirt un set
in de chimerly-corner tell dee look lak dee
bin smoke-dried. De Lord know what
make Jesse Waynecroft fetch he famerly
’mongst folk lak deze.”</p>

<p>This was mildness itself compared with
some of Mom Bi’s harangues later on, when
the “sandhillers,” urged by some of the energetic
citizens of the village, were forming a
military company to be offered to the Governor
of Virginia for the defense of that
State. This was in the summer of 1861.
There was a great stir in the South. The
martial spirit of the people had been aroused
by the fiery eloquence of the political leaders,
and the volunteers were mustering in
every town and village. The “sandhillers”
were not particularly enthusiastic—they
had but vague ideas of the issues at stake—but
the military business was something
new to them, and therefore alluring. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
volunteered readily if not cheerfully, and it
was not long before there was a company of
them mustering under the name of the Rifle
Rangers—an attractive title to the ear if
not to the understanding.</p>

<p>Mom Bi was very much interested in the
maneuvers of the Rifle Rangers. She
watched them with a scornful and a critical
eye. Even in their uniforms, which were
of the holiday pattern, their appearance was
the reverse of soldierly. They were hollow-chested
and round-shouldered, and exceedingly
awkward in all their movements.
Their maneuvers on the outskirts of the
village, accompanied by the music of fife
and drum, always drew a crowd of idlers,
and among these interested spectators Mom
Bi was usually to be found.</p>

<p>“Dee gwine fight,” she would say to the
Waynecroft children, in her loud and rasping
voice. “Dee gwine kill folks right un left.
Look at um! I done git skeer’d myse’f,
dee look so ’vigrous. Ki! dee gwine eat
dem Yankee up fer true. I sorry fer dem
Yankee, un I skeer’d fer myse’f! When
dee smell dem vittle what dem Yankee got,
’tis good-by, Yankee! Look at um, honey!
dee gwine fight fer rich folks’ nigger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The drilling and mustering went on, however,
and Mom Bi was permitted to say
what she pleased. Some laughed at her,
others regarded her with something like superstitious
awe, while a great many thought
she was merely a harmless simpleton.
Above all, she was Judge Waynecroft’s
family servant, and this fact was an ample
apology in Fairleigh and its environs for
anything that she might say.</p>

<p>The mustering of the “sandhillers” irritated
Mom Bi; but when the family returned
to Charleston in the winter, the
preparations for war that she saw going on
made a definite and profound impression on
her. At night she would go into her mistress’s
room, sit on the hearth in a corner of
the fire-place, and watch the fire in the
grate. Nursing her withered arm, she
would sit silent for an hour at a time, and
when she did speak it seemed as if her
tongue had lost something of its characteristic
asperity.</p>

<p>“I think,” said Mrs. Waynecroft, on one
occasion, “that Mom Bi is getting religion.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’ll never get it any younger,”
the Judge replied.</p>

<p>Mom Bi, sitting in her corner, pretended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
not to hear, but after a while she said: “Ef
de Lord call me in de chu’ch, I gwine; ef
he no call I no gwine—enty? I no yerry
him call dis long time.”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked the Judge, “something
has cooled you off and toned you
down, and I was in hopes you were in the
mourners’ seat.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” exclaimed Mom Bi. “How
come I gwine go in mourner seat? What
I gwine do in dey?” Then pointing to a
portrait of Gabriel Waynecroft hanging over
the mantel, she cried out: “Wey he bin
gone at?”</p>

<p>Gabriel was the eldest son, the hope and
pride of the family. The Judge and his
wife looked at each other.</p>

<p>“I think you know where he has gone,”
said Mrs. Waynecroft, gently. “He has
gone to fight for his country.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” the old woman grunted. Then,
after a pause, “Wey dem san’hillers bin
gone at? Wey de country what dee fight
fer?”</p>

<p>“Why, what are you talking about?”
said Judge Waynecroft, who had been listening
behind his newspaper. “This is their
country too, and they have gone to fight for
it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>“’Longside dat boy?” Mom Bi asked.
Her voice rose as she pointed at Gabriel’s
picture.</p>

<p>“Why, certainly,” said the Judge.</p>

<p>“<em>Pishou!</em>” exclaimed Mom Bi, with a
hiss that was the very essence of scorn, contempt
and unbelief. “Oona nee’n’ tell me
dat ting. I nuttin’ but nigger fer true, but
I know better dun dat. I bin nuss dat boy,
un I know um troo un troo. Dat boy, ’e
cut ’e t’roat fus’ fo’ ’e fight ’longside dem
trash. When ’e be en tell-a you ’e gwine
fight ’longside dem whut de Lord done fersooken
dis long time?”</p>

<p>The Judge smiled, but Mrs. Waynecroft
looked serious; Mom Bi rocked backward
and forward, as if nursing her withered
arm.</p>

<p>“Whut dem po’ white trash gwine fight
fer? Nuttin’ ’tall ain’t bin tell me dat.
Dee ain’t bin had no nigger; dee ain’t bin
had no money; dee ain’t bin had no lan’;
dee ain’t bin had nuttin’ ’tall. Un den ’pun
top er dat, yer come folks fer tell me dat
dat boy gwine fight ’longside dem creeturs.”</p>

<p>Mom Bi laughed loudly, and shook her
long finger at the portrait of young Gabriel
Waynecroft. As a work of art the portrait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
was a failure, having been painted by an
ambitious amateur; but, crude as it was,
it showed a face of wonderful refinement.
The features were as delicate as those of
a woman, with the exception of the chin,
which was full and firm. The eyes, large
and lustrous, gazed from the canvas with a
suggestion of both tenderness and fearlessness.</p>

<p>During the long and dreary days that followed—days
of waiting, days of suffering
and of sorrow—there were many changes
in the Waynecroft household, but Mom Bi
held her place. She remained as virile and
as active as ever. If any change was noticeable
it was that her temper was more uncertain
and her voice shriller. All her talk
was about the war; and as the contest wore
on, with no perceptible advantage to the
Confederates, she assumed the character and
functions of a prophetess. Among the negroes,
especially those who had never come
in familiar contact with the whites, she was
looked upon as a person to be feared and
respected. Naturally, they argued that any
black who talked to the white people as
Mom Bi did must possess at least sufficient
occult power to escape punishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes, in the pleasant weather, while
walking with her mistress and the children
on the battery at Charleston she would reach
forth her hand and exclaim:</p>

<p>“Oona see dem wharfs? Dee gwine be
fill wid Yankee ships! Dee gwine sail right
stret up, un nuttin’ ’t all gwine stop um.”</p>

<p>Then, turning to the town, she would say:</p>

<p>“Oona see dem street? Dee gwine fair
swarm wid Yankee! Dee gwine march troo
’um, un nuttin’ ’t all gwine stop um. Oona
see dem gang er nigger down dey? Dee
gwine be free, un nuttin’ ’t all gwine stop um.
Dee’l be free, un ole Bi gwine be free. Ah,
Lord! when de drum start fer beat, un de
trumpet start fer blow, de white folks gwine
los de nigger. Ki! I mos’ yeddy dem now.”</p>

<p>This was repeated, not once, but hundreds
of times—in the house and on the streets,
wherever Mom Bi went. At the market,
while the venders were weighing out supplies
for the Waynecroft household, Mom
Bi would take advantage of the occasion to
preach a sermon about the war and to utter
prophecies about the freedom of the negroes.
Her fearlessness was her best protection.
Those who heard her had no doubt that she
was a lunatic, and so she was allowed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
come and go in peace, at a time when the
great mass of the negroes were under the
strictest surveillance. It made no difference
to Mom Bi, however, whether one or a thousand
eyes were watching her, or whether the
whole world thought she was crazy. She
was in earnest, and thus presented a spectacle
that is rarer than a great many people
are willing to admit.</p>

<p>The old woman went her way, affording
amusement to some and to others food for
thought; and the rest of the world went its
way, especially that part of it that was
watching events from rifle-pits and trenches.
To those at home the years seemed to drag,
though they went fast enough, no doubt, for
those at the front. They went fast enough
to mark some marvelous changes and developments.
Hundreds of thousands of times,
it happened that a gun fired in Virginia
sorely wounded the hearts of a household
far away.</p>

<p>On the Shenandoah, one night, a sharpshooter
in blue heard the clatter of a horse’s
hoofs on the turnpike, and the jangling of
sword, spurs and bit. As the horseman
came into view in the moonlight, the sharpshooter
leveled his rifle. There was a flash,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
a puff of smoke, and a report that broke
into a hundred crackling echoes on the still
night air. The horse that had been held so
well in hand galloped wildly away with an
empty saddle. The comrades of the cavalryman,
who had been following him at a
little distance, rushed forward at the report
of the gun, and found their handsome young
officer lying in the road, dead. They scoured
the country for some distance around, but
they saw nothing and heard nothing, and
finally they lifted the dead soldier to a
horse, and carried him back to their camp.</p>

<p>The sharpshooter had aimed only at the
dashing young cavalryman, but his shot
struck a father and a mother in Charleston,
and an old negro woman who was supposed
to be crazy; and the wounds that it made
were grievous. The cavalryman was young
Gabriel Waynecroft, and with the ending of
his life the hope and expectations of the
family seemed to be blotted out. He had
been the darling of the household, the pride
of his father, the joy of his mother, and the
idol of Mom Bi. When the news of his
death came, the grief of the household took
the shape of consternation. It was terrible
to behold. The mother was prostrated and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
the father crushed. Their sorrow was voiceless.
Mom Bi went about wringing her
hands and moaning and talking to herself
day after day.</p>

<p>Once, Judge Waynecroft, passing through
the hall in slippered feet, thought he heard
voices in the sitting-room. In an aimless
way, he glanced in the room, and the sight
made him pause. Mom Bi was sitting in
the middle of the room in a low chair, gazing
at the portrait of Gabriel Waynecroft,
and talking to it. She spoke in a soft and
tender tone, in strange contrast to the usual
rasping and irritating quality of her voice.</p>

<p>“Look at me, honey,” she was saying;
“look at you’ ole nigger mammy! Whut
make dee lef’ you fer go way down, dey wey
one folks kill turrer folks? Tell de ole nigger
mammy dat, honey. Whaffer dee no
lef’ dem no ’count san’hillers fer do all de
fightin’? Who gwine fer cry wun dee git
kilt? Fightin’ fer nigger! Whaffer you’
daddy no sen’ he niggers fer fight? De
Lord know dee plenty un um. Nummine,
honey! ’T ain’t gwine fer be long, ’fo’ dee’ll
all know whut de Lord know, un whut ole
Bi know. Gi’ um time, honey! des gi’ um
time!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Judge Waynecroft turned away with a
groan. To behold the bewildered grief of
this old negro woman was to add a new
pang to his own sorrow. Mom Bi paused,
but did not turn her head. She heard her
master pass down the hall with uncertain
step, and then she heard the library door
shut.</p>

<p>“’Tis de gospel troot ’e bin yeddy me
preachin’,” she exclaimed. Then she turned
again to the portrait and gazed at it steadily
and in silence for a long while, rocking
herself and nursing her withered arm.</p>

<p>When the body of Gabriel Waynecroft
was brought home, Mom Bi kneeled on the
floor at the foot of the coffin and stayed
there, giving utterance to the wildest lamentations.
Some friend or acquaintance of the
family made an attempt to remove her.</p>

<p>“This will never do,” he said kindly, but
firmly. “You must get up and go away.
The noise you are making distresses and disturbs
the family.”</p>

<p>Trembling with mingled grief and rage,
Mom Bi turned upon the officious person.</p>

<p>“I ain’t, I ain’t, I ain’t!” she almost
shrieked. “I gwine fer stay right wey I is.
Take you’ han’ fum off me, man! I bin cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
on count dat chile mos’ ’fo’ he own mammy
is. I bin nuss um, I bin worry wid um, I
bin stay ’wake wid um wun ev’body wuz
sleep, un I bin hol’ um in my lap day un
night, wun ’e sick un wun ’e well. I ain’t
gwine out! I ain’t! I ain’t!”</p>

<p>In fine, Mom Bi made a terrible scene,
and the officious person who wanted to drive
her out was glad to get out himself, which
he was compelled to do in order to escape
the clamor that he had unwittingly raised.</p>

<p>The death and burial of Gabriel Waynecroft
was a gloomy episode in Mom Bi’s experience,
and it left its marks upon her.
She lost none of her old-time vigor, but her
temper became almost unbearable. She was
surly, irritable and sometimes violent, especially
toward the negroes on the place, who
regarded her with a superstitious fear that
would be difficult to explain or describe.
Left to herself she did well enough. She
loved to sit in the sun and talk to herself.
The other negroes had a theory that she
saw spirits and conversed with them; but
they were welcome to their theories, so far
as Mom Bi was concerned, provided they
didn’t pester her.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sherman’s army was marching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
through Georgia to Savannah, and in
Virginia Grant was arranging the plans of
his last campaign. Savannah fell, and then
came the information that Sherman’s army
was moving on Charleston. The city could
be defended in only one direction: all its
bristles pointed seaward; and the Confederate
troops prepared to evacuate. All these
movements were well known to the negroes,
especially to Mom Bi, and she made use of
her information to renew her prophecies.
She stood in the porch of her master’s house
and watched the Confederates file by, greeting
them occasionally with irritating comment.</p>

<p>“Hi! Wey you gwine? Whaffer you no
stop fer tell folks good-by? Nummine!
Dem Yankee buckra, dee gwine shaky you
by de han’. Dee mek you hot fer true.
Wey you no stop fer see de nigger come
free?”</p>

<p>Most of Mom Bi’s prophecies came true.
Sherman marched northward, and then came
Appomattox. One day, shortly after the
surrender, Mom Bi appeared before Judge
Waynecroft and his wife rigged out in her
best clothes. She was rather more subdued
than usual. She entered the room, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
stood still, looking first at one and then at
the other.</p>

<p>“Well, Bi,” said the Judge, kindly,
“what can we do for you?”</p>

<p>“Nuttin’ ’t all. I gwine down dey at Sawanny,
wey my daughter is bin live.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean Maria?”</p>

<p>“My daughter ’Ria, w’at you bin sell to
John Waynecroft. I gwine down dey wey
she live at.”</p>

<p>“Why, you are too old to be gadding
about,” said the Judge. “Why not stay
here where you have a comfortable home?”</p>

<p>“I think you are very foolish to even
dream of such a thing, Mom Bi. Maria is
not able to take care of you.”</p>

<p>“I gwine down dey wey my daughter bin
live at,” persisted Mom Bi. Then she
looked at the portrait of Gabriel Waynecroft.
The beautiful boyish face seemed to
arouse her. Turning suddenly, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“De Lord know I done bin fergive you-all
fer sellin’ ’Ria ’way fum me. De Lord
know I is! Wun I bin see you set down
un let dat chile go off fer git kill’”—Mom
Bi pointed her long and quivering finger at
Gabriel’s portrait—“wun I see dis, I say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
‘hush up, nigger! don’t bodder ’bout ’Ria.’
De Lord know I done bin fergive you!”</p>

<p>With this Mom Bi turned to the door
and passed out.</p>

<p>“Won’t you tell us good-by?” the Judge
asked.</p>

<p>“I done bin fergive you,” said Mom Bi.</p>

<p>“I think you might tell us good-by,” said
Mrs. Waynecroft, with tears in her eyes and
voice.</p>

<p>“I done bin fergive you,” was the answer.</p>

<p>This was in June. One morning months
afterward Judge Waynecroft was informed
by a policeman that a crazy old negro woman
had been arrested in the cemetery.</p>

<p>“She is continually talking about Gabriel
Waynecroft,” said the officer, “and the
Captain thought you might know something
about her. She’s got the temper of Old
Harry,” he continued, “and old and crippled
as she is, she’s as strong as a bull yearling.”</p>

<p>It was Mom Bi, and she was carried to
her old master’s home. Little by little she
told the story of her visit to Savannah. She
found her daughter and her family in a
most deplorable condition. The children
had the small-pox, and finally Maria was
seized with the disease. For lack of food<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
and proper attention they all died, and Mom
Bi found herself alone and friendless in a
strange city. How she managed to make
her way back home it is impossible to say,
but she returned.</p>

<p>The Mom Bi who returned, however, was
not the same Mom Bi that went away. Old
age had overtaken her in Savannah. Her
eyes were hollow, her face was pinched and
shrunken, the flesh on her bones had shriveled,
and her limbs shook as with the palsy.
When she was helped into the house that
had so long been her home she looked
around at the furniture and the walls. Finally
her eyes rested on the portrait of Gabriel
Waynecroft. She smiled a little and
then said feebly:</p>

<p>“I done bin come back. I bin come back
fer stay; but I free, dough!”</p>

<p>In a little while she was freer still. She
had passed beyond the reach of mortal care
or pain; and, as in the old days, she went
without bidding her friends good-by.</p>

<h2 id="THE_OLD_BASCOM_PLACE">THE OLD BASCOM PLACE.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p>One Saturday afternoon in the spring of
1876, as Farmer Joe-Bob Grissom was on
his way to Hillsborough for the purpose of
hearing the news and having an evening’s
chat with his town acquaintances,—as was
his invariable custom at the close of the
week,—he saw, as he passed the old Bascom
Place, an old gentleman and a young
lady walking slowly along the road. The
old gentleman was tall and thin, and had silvery
white hair. He wore a high-crowned,
wide-brimmed felt hat, and his clothes,
though neat, were too glossy to be new.
The young lady was just developing into
womanhood. She had a striking face and
figure. Her eyes were large and brilliantly
black; her hair, escaping from under her
straw hat with its scarlet ribbons, fell in
dusky masses to her waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>The two walked slowly, and occasionally
they paused while the old gentleman pointed
in various directions with his cane, as though
impressing on the mind of his companion
the whereabouts of certain interesting landmarks.
They were followed at a little distance
by a negro, who carried across his arm
a light wrap which seemed to be a part of
the outfit of the young lady.</p>

<p>As Farmer Joe-Bob Grissom passed the
two, he bowed and tipped his hat by way of
salutation. The old gentleman raised his
hat and bowed with great courtliness, and
the young lady nodded her head and smiled
pleasantly at him. Farmer Joe-Bob was old
enough to be grizzly, but the smile stirred
him. It seemed to be a direct challenge to
his memory. Where had he seen the young
lady before? Where had he met the old
gentleman? He was puzzled to such an extent
that he paid no attention to the negro
man, who touched his hat and bowed politely
as the farmer passed—a fact that
made the negro wonder a little; for day in
and out he had known Mr. Joe-Bob Grissom
nearly forty years, and never before had that
worthy citizen failed to respond with a cordial
“Howdy” when the negro took off his
hat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Farmer Joe-Bob Grissom walked on towards
town, which was not far, and the old
gentleman and the young lady walked slowly
along the hedge of Cherokee roses that ran
around the old Bascom Place, while the negro
followed at a respectful distance. Once
they paused, and the old gentleman rubbed
his eyes with a hand that trembled a little.</p>

<p>“Why, darling!” he exclaimed in a tone
of mingled grief and astonishment, “they
have cut it down.”</p>

<p>“Cut what down, father?”</p>

<p>“Why, the weeping-willow. Don’t you
remember it, daughter? It stood in the
middle of the field yonder. It was a noble
tree. Well, well, well! What next, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“I do not remember it, father; I have so
much to”—</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” the old gentleman interrupted.
“Of course you couldn’t remember. The
place has been so changed that I seem to
have forgotten it myself. It has been turned
topsy-turvy; it has been ruined—ruined!”</p>

<p>He leaned on his cane, and with quivering
lips and moist eyes looked through the green
perspective of the park, and over the fertile
fields and meadows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ruined!” exclaimed the young lady.
“How can you say so, father? I never saw
a more beautiful place. It would make a
lovely picture.”</p>

<p>“And they have ruined the house, too.
The whole roof has been changed.” The
old man pulled his hat down over his eyes,
his hand trembling more than ever. “Let
us turn back, Mildred,” he said after a while.
“The sight of all this frets and worries me
more than I thought it would.”</p>

<p>“They say,” said the daughter, “that the
gentleman who owns the place has made a
good deal of money.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied the father, “I suppose so—I
suppose so. Yes, so I have heard. A
great many people are making money now
who never made it before—a great many.”</p>

<p>“I wish they would tell us the secret,”
said the young lady, laughing a little.</p>

<p>“There is no secret about it,” said the
old gentleman; “none whatever. To make
money you must be mean and niggardly
yourself, and then employ others to be mean
and niggardly for you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is not always so, father,” the
young girl exclaimed.</p>

<p>“It <em>was</em> not always so, my daughter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
There <em>was</em> a time when one could make
money and remain a gentleman; but that
was many years ago.”</p>

<p>The young lady was apparently not anxious
to continue the argument, for she lightly
turned the conversation into a more agreeable
channel; and so the two, still followed
by the negro, made their way through the
shaded streets of the town.</p>

<p>That evening, when Mr. Joe-Bob Grissom,
after making some little purchases
about town, went to the hotel, which he
persisted in calling a tavern, he found Major
Jimmy Bass engaged in a hot political
discussion with a crowd which included a
number of the townspeople, as well as a
sprinkling of commercial travelers. Major
Jimmy was one of the ancient and venerable
landmarks of that region. He had once
been an active politician, and had been engaged
in political discussion for forty years
or more. Old and fat as he was, he knew
how to talk, and nothing pleased him more
than to get hold of a stranger when a crowd
of sympathetic fellow-citizens, young and old,
was present to applaud the points he made.</p>

<p>Whenever Mr. Joe-Bob Grissom appeared
in the veranda of the hotel he made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
it a point to shake hands with every person
present, friend and stranger alike. His politeness
was a trifle elaborate, but it was
genuine.</p>

<p>“Why, howdy, Joe-Bob, howdy!” exclaimed
Major Bass with effusion. “You
seem to turn up at the right time, like the
spangled man in the circus. I’m glad
you’ve come, an’ ef I’d ’a’ had my way
you’d ’a’ come sooner, bekaze you’re jest a
little too late fer to see me slap the argyments
onto some of these here travelin’
drummers. They are gone now,” the major
continued, with a sweeping gesture of
his right arm. “They are gone, but I
wisht mightily you’d ’a’ been here. New
things is mortal nice, I know; but when
these new-issue chaps set up to out-talk men
that’s old enough to be their grand-daddy, it
does me a sight of good fer to see ’em took
down a peg er two.”</p>

<p>As soon as he could get in a word edgewise,
farmer Joe-Bob Grissom attempted to
turn the conversation in a direction calculated
to satisfy his curiosity.</p>

<p>“Major,” he said in his deliberate way,
“what’s this I see out yonder at the old
Bascom Place?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Lord only knows, Joe-Bob. What
might be the complexion, er yet the character,
of it?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Grissom, “as I was
makin’ to’rds town a little while ago, I seen
some folks that don’t look like they b’long
’roun’ here. One of ’em was a old man, an’
t’ other one was a young gal, an’ a nigger
man was a-follerin’ of ’em up—an’, ef I
make no mistakes, the nigger man was your
old Jess. I didn’t look close at the nigger,
but arter I’d passed him it come to me that
it wa’n’t nobody on the topside of the roun’
worl’ but Jess.”</p>

<p>“Why, bless your life an’ soul!” exclaimed
Major Bass, giving farmer Joe-Bob
a neighborly nudge, “don’t you know who
them folks was? Well, well! Where’s
your mind? Why, that was old Briscoe
Bascom an’ his daughter.”</p>

<p>“I say it!” exclaimed farmer Joe-Bob,
hitching his chair closer to the major.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said the major, “that’s who
it was. Why, where on earth have you
been? The old Judge drapped in on the
town some weeks ago, an’ he’s been here
ever sence. He’s been here long enough
for the gal to make up a school. Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Lord! What a big swing the world’s in!
High on one side, high on t’ other, an’ the
old cat a-dyin, in the middle! Why, bless
your heart, Joe-Bob! I’ve seed the time
when ef old Judge Briscoe Bascom jest so
much as bowed to me I’d feel proud fer a
week. An’ now look at ’im! Ef I knowed
I’d be took off wi’ the dropsy the nex’ minute,
I wouldn’t swap places wi’ the poor
old creetur.”</p>

<p>“But what is old Jess a-doin’ doggin’ ’long
arter ’em that a-way?” inquired Mr. Grissom,
knitting his shaggy eyebrows.</p>

<p>“That’s what pesters me,” exclaimed the
major. “Ef niggers was ree-sponsible fer
what they done, it would be wuss than what
it is. Now you take Jesse: you needn’t
tell me that nigger ain’t got sense; yit what
does he do? You seen ’im wi’ your own
eyes. Why, sir,” continued the major,
growing more emphatic, “I bought that
nigger from Judge Bascom’s cousin when he
wa’n’t nothin’ but a youngster, an’ I took
him home an’ raised him up right in the
house,—yes, sir, right in the house,—an’
he’s been a-hangin’ ’roun’ me off an’ on,
gittin’ his vittles, his clozes, an’ his lodgin’.
Yit, look at him now! I wisht I may die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
dead ef that nigger didn’t hitch onto old
Judge Bascom the minute he landed in
town. Yes, sir! I’m a-tellin’ you no lie.
It’s a clean, naked fact. That nigger quit
me an’ went an’ took up wi’ the old judge.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Grissom, stroking his
unshorn face, “you know what the sayin’ is:
Niggers ’ll be niggers even ef you whitewash
’em twice a week.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” remarked the major thoughtfully;
“I hope to goodness they’ve got souls, but
I misdoubt it. Lord, yes, I misdoubt it
mightily.”</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>As Major Jimmy Bass used to say, the
years cut many queer capers as they go by.
The major in his own proper person had not
only witnessed, but had been the victim, of
these queer capers. Hillsborough was a
very small place indeed, and, for that very
reason perhaps, it was more sensitive to
changes in the way of progress and decay
than many larger and more ambitious towns.</p>

<p>However this may have been, it is certain
that the town, assisted by the major, had
noted the queer capers the years had cut in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
the neighborhood of the old Bascom Place.
This attitude on the part of Hillsborough—including,
of course, Major Jimmy Bass—may
be accounted for partly by the fact
that the old place had once been the pride
and delight of the town, and partly by the
fact that the provincial eye and mind are
nervously alert to whatever happens within
range of their observation.</p>

<p>Before and during the war the Bascom
Place was part and parcel of a magnificent
estate. The domain was so extensive and
so well managed that it was noted far and
wide. Its boundary lines inclosed more
than four thousand acres of forests and cultivated
fields. This immense body of land
was known as the old Bascom Place.</p>

<p>Bolling Bascom, its first owner, went to
Georgia not long after the close of the Revolution,
with a large number of Virginians
who proposed to establish a colony in what
was then the far South. The colony settled
in Wilkes County; but Bolling Bascom,
more adventurous than the rest, pushed on
into middle Georgia, crossed the Oconee,
and built him a home, and such was his
taste, his energy, and his thrift, that the results
thereof may be seen and admired in
Hillsborough to this day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>But the man, like so many of his fellow-citizens
then and thereafter, was land-hungry.
He bought and bought until he had
acquired the immense domain, which, by
some special interposition of fate or circumstance,
is still intact. Meantime he had
built him a house which was in keeping
with the extent and richness of his landed
possessions. It was planned in the old colonial
style, but its massive proportions
were relieved by the tall red chimneys and
the long and gracefully fashioned colonnade
that gave both strength and beauty to the
spacious piazza which ran, and still runs, the
whole length of the house.</p>

<p>When Bolling Bascom died, in 1830,
aged seventy years, as the faded inscription
on the storm-beaten tablet in the churchyard
shows, he left his son, Briscoe Bascom,
to own and manage the vast estate. This
son was thirty years old, and it was said of
him that he inherited the gentle qualities of
his mother rather than the fiery energy and
ambition of his father.</p>

<p>Bolling Bascom was neither vicious nor
reckless, but he was a thorough man of the
world. He was, in short, a typical Virginian
gentleman, who for his own purposes
had settled in Georgia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Whatever the cause of his emigration, it
is certain that Georgia gained a good citizen.
It was said of him that he was a little too
fond of a fiddle, but with all his faults—with
all his love for horse-racing and fox-hunting—he
found time to be kind to his
neighbors, generous to his friends, and the
active leader of every movement calculated
to benefit the State or the people; and it
may be remarked in passing, that he also
found time to look after his own affairs.</p>

<p>Naturally, he was prominent in politics.
He represented his county in the legislature,
was at one time a candidate for governor,
and was altogether a man who had the
love and the confidence of his neighbors.
He gave his son the benefit of the best education
the country afforded, and made the
tour of Europe with him, going over the
ground that he himself had gone over in his
young days.</p>

<p>But his European trip, undertaken when
he was an old man, was too much for him.
He was seized with an illness on his return
voyage, and, although he lived long enough
to reach home, he never recovered. In a
few years his wife died; and his son, with
little or no experience in such matters,—since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
his time had been taken up by the
schools and colleges,—was left to manage
the estate as best he could.</p>

<p>It was the desire of Bolling Bascom that
his son should study law and make that profession
a stepping-stone to a political career.
He had been ambitious himself, and he
hoped his son would also be ambitious. Besides,
was not politics the most respectable
of all the professions? This was certainly
the view in Bolling Bascom’s day and time,
and much might be said to support it. Of
all the professions, politics opened up the
one career best calculated to tickle the fancy
of the rich young men.</p>

<p>To govern, to control, to make laws, to
look after the welfare of the people, to make
great speeches, to become statesmen—these
were the ideas that filled the minds of ambitious
men in Bolling Bascom’s time, and
for years thereafter. And why not? There
were the examples of Jefferson, Madison,
Monroe, Randolph, Hamilton, Webster, Calhoun,
and the Adamses of Massachusetts.
What better could a young man do than to
follow in the footsteps of these illustrious
citizens?</p>

<p>It may be supposed, therefore, that Bolling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Bascom had mapped out a tremendous
career for his son and heir. No doubt, as
he sat dozing on his piazza in the long summer
afternoons near the close of his life, he
fancied he could hear the voice of his boy
in the halls of legislation, or hear the wild
shouts of the multitudes that greeted his efforts
on the stump in the heat and fury of
a campaign. But it was not to be. The
stormy politics of that period had no charms
for Briscoe Bascom. He was a student, and
he preferred his book to the companionship
of the crowd.</p>

<p>He possessed both courage and sociability
in the highest degree, but he was naturally
indolent, and he was proud—too indolent
to find pleasure in the whirling confusion of
active politics, and too proud to go about his
county or his State in the attitude of soliciting
the suffrages of his fellow-citizens. That
he would have made his mark in politics is
certain, for he made it at the bar, where
success is much more dearly bought. He
finally became judge of the superior court,
at a time when the judges of the circuit
courts met annually and formed a court of
appeals. His decisions in this appellate
court attracted attention all over the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
and are still referred to in the legal literature
of to-day as models of their kind.</p>

<p>And yet all that Briscoe Bascom accomplished
at the bar and on the bench was the
result of intuition rather than of industry.
Indolence sat enthroned in his nature, patient
but vigilant. When he retired from
the bench, he gave up the law altogether.
He might have reclaimed his large practice,
but he preferred the ease and quiet of his
home.</p>

<p>He was an old man before he married—old
enough, that is to say, to marry a woman
many years his junior. His wife had been
reared in an atmosphere of extravagance;
and although she was a young woman of
gentle breeding and of the best intentions, it
is certain that she did not go to the Bascom
Place as its mistress for the purpose of stinting
or economizing. She simply gave no
thought to the future. But she was so
bright and beautiful, so gentle and unaffected
in speech and manner, so gracious
and so winsome in all directions, that it
seemed nothing more than natural and right
that her every whim and wish should be
gratified.</p>

<p>Judge Bascom was indulgent and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
than indulgent. He applauded his wife’s
extravagance and followed her example.
Before many years he began to reap some of
the fruits thereof, and they were exceeding
bitter to the taste. The longest purse that
ever was made has a bottom to it, unless, indeed,
it be lined with Franklin’s maxims.</p>

<p>The Judge was forty-eight years old when
he married, and even before the beginning
of the war he found his financial affairs in
an uncomfortable condition. The Bascom
Place was intact, but the pocket-book of its
master was in a state bordering on collapse.</p>

<p>The slow but sure approach to the inevitable
need not be described here. It is familiar
to all people in all lands and times.
In the case of Judge Bascom, however, the
war was in the nature of a breathing-spell.
It brought with it an era of extravagance
that overshadowed everything that had been
dreamed of theretofore. During the first
two years there was money enough for everybody
and to spare. It was manufactured in
Richmond in great stacks. General Robert
Toombs, who was an interested observer, has
aptly described the facility with which the
Confederacy supplied itself with money.
“A dozen negroes,” said he, “printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
money on the hand-presses all day to supply
the government, and then they worked until
nine o’clock at night printing money enough
to pay themselves off.”</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, Judge Bascom
and his charming wife could be as extravagant
or as economical as they pleased without
attracting the attention of their neighbors
or their creditors. Nobody had time
to think or care about such small matters.
The war-fever was at its height, and nothing
else occupied the attention of the people.
The situation was so favorable, indeed, that
Judge Bascom began to redeem his fortune—in
Confederate money. He had land
enough and negroes a plenty, and so he
saved his money by storing it away; and he
was so successful in this business that it is
said that when the war closed he had a
wagon-load of Confederate notes and shin-plaster
packed in trunks and chests.</p>

<p>The crash came when General Sherman
went marching through Hillsborough. The
Bascom Place, being the largest and the
richest plantation in that neighborhood, suffered
the worst. Every horse, every mule,
every living thing with hide and hoof, was
driven off by the Federals; and a majority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of the negroes went along with the army.
It was often said of Judge Bascom that “he
had so many negroes he didn’t know them
when he met them in the big road;” and
this was probably true. His negroes knew
him, and knew that he was a kind master in
many respects, but they had no personal
affection for him. They were such strangers
to the Judge that they never felt justified in
complaining to him even when the overseers
ill-treated them. Consequently, when Sherman
went marching along, the great majority
of them bundled up their little effects
and followed after the army. They had
nothing to bind them to the old place. The
house-servants, and a few negroes in whom
the Judge took a personal interest, remained,
but all the rest went away.</p>

<p>Then, in a few months, came the news of
the surrender, bringing with it a species of
paralysis or stupefaction from which the
people were long in recovering—so long,
indeed, that some of them died in despair,
while others lingered on the stage, watching,
with dim eyes and trembling limbs, half-hopefully
and half-fretfully, the representatives
of a new generation trying to build up
the waste places. There was nothing left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
for Judge Bascom to do but to take his
place among the spectators. He would have
returned to his law-practice, but the people
had well-nigh forgotten that he had ever
been a lawyer; moreover, the sheriffs were
busier in those days than the lawyers. He
had the incentive,—for the poverty of
those days was pinching,—but he lacked the
energy and the strength necessary to begin
life anew. He and hundreds like him were
practically helpless. Ordinarily experience
is easily learned when necessity is the
teacher, but it was too late for necessity to
teach Judge Bascom anything. During all
his life he had never known what want was.
He had never had occasion to acquire tact,
business judgment, or economy. Inheriting
a vast estate, he had no need to practice
thrift or become familiar with the shifty
methods whereby business men fight their
way through the world. Of all such matters
he was entirely ignorant.</p>

<p>To add to his anxiety, a girl had been
born to him late in life, his first and only
child. In his confusion and perplexity he
was prepared to regard the little stranger as
merely a new and dreadful responsibility,
but it was not long before his daughter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
a source of great comfort to him. Yet, as
the negroes said, she was not a “luck-child;”
and bad as the Judge’s financial
condition was, it grew steadily worse.</p>

<p>Briefly, the world had drifted past him and
his contemporaries and left them stranded.
Under the circumstances, what was he to
do? It is true he had a magnificent plantation,
but this merely added to his poverty.
Negro labor was demoralized, and the overseer
class had practically disappeared. He
would have sold a part of his landed estate;
indeed, so pressing were his needs that he
would have sold everything except the house
which his father had built, and where he
himself was born,—that he would not have
parted with for all the riches in the world,—but
there was nobody to buy. The
Judge’s neighbors and his friends, with the
exception of those who had accustomed
themselves to seizing all contingencies by
the throat and wresting tribute from them,
were in as severe a strait as he was; and to
make matters worse, the political affairs of
the State were in the most appalling condition.
It was the period of reconstruction—a
scheme that paralyzed all whom it failed
to corrupt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally the Judge’s wife took matters into
her own hand. She had relatives in Atlanta,
and she prevailed on him to go to
that lively and picturesque town. He closed
his house, being unable to rent it, and became
a citizen of the thrifty city. He found
himself in a new atmosphere. The north
Georgia crackers, the east Tennesseeans,—having
dropped their “you-uns” and “we-uns,”—and
the Yankees had joined hands
in building up and pushing Atlanta forward.
Business was more important than politics;
and the rush and whirl of men and things
were enough to make a mere spectator dizzy.
Judge Bascom found himself more helpless
than ever; but through the influence of his
wife’s brother he was appointed to a small
clerkship in one of the State departments,
and—“Humiliation of humiliations!” his
friends exclaimed—he promptly accepted
it, and became a part of what was known as
the “carpet-bag” government. The appointment
was in the nature of a godsend,
but the Judge found himself ostracized.
His friends and acquaintances refused to return
his salutation as he met them on the
street. To a proud and sensitive man this
was the bitterness of death, but Judge Bascom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
stuck to his desk and made no complaint.</p>

<p>By some means or other, no doubt through
the influence of Mrs. Bascom, the Judge’s
brother-in-law, a thrifty and not over-scrupulous
man, obtained a power of attorney, and
sold the Bascom Place, house and all, to a
gentleman from western New York who was
anxious to settle in middle Georgia. Just
how much of the purchase-money went into
the Judge’s hands it is impossible to say,
but it is known that he fell into a terrible
rage when he was told that the house had
been sold along with the place. He denounced
the sale as a swindle, and declared
that as he had been born in the house he
would die there, and not all the powers of
earth could prevent him.</p>

<p>But the money that he received was a
substantial thing as far as it went. Gradually
he found himself surrounded by various
comforts that he had sadly missed, and in
time he became somewhat reconciled to the
sale, though he never gave up the idea that
he would buy the old place back and live
there again. The idea haunted him day
and night.</p>

<p>After the downfall of the carpet-bag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
administration a better feeling took possession
of the people and politicians, and it was not
long before Judge Bascom found congenial
work in codifying the laws of the State,
which had been in a somewhat confused and
tangled condition since the war. Meanwhile
his daughter Mildred was growing up,
developing remarkable beauty as well as
strength of mind. At a very early age she
began to “take the responsibility,” as the
Judge put it, of managing the household
affairs, and she continued to manage them
even while going to school. At school she
won the hearts of teachers and pupils, not
less by her aptitude in her books than by
her beauty and engaging manners.</p>

<p>But in spite of the young girl’s management—in
spite of the example she set by
her economy—the Judge and his wife continued
to grow poorer and poorer. Neither
of them knew the value of a dollar, and
the money that had been received from the
sale of the Bascom Place was finally exhausted.
About this time Mrs. Bascom
died, and the Judge was so prostrated by
his bereavement that it was months before
he recovered. When he did recover he had
lost all interest in his work of codification,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
but it was so nearly completed and was so
admirably done that the legislature voted
him extra pay. This modest sum the
daughter took charge of, and when her
father was well enough she proposed that
they return to Hillsborough, where they
could take a small house, and where she
could give music lessons and teach a primary
school. It need not be said that the Judge
gave an eager assent to the proposition.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>As Mr. Joe-Bob Grissom passed the Bascom
Place on his way home, after gathering
from Major Jimmy Bass all the news and
gossip of the town, he heard Mr. Francis
Underwood, the owner of the Place, walking
up and down the piazza, singing. Mr. Underwood
appeared to be in a cheerful mood,
and he had a right to be. He was young,—not
more than thirty,—full of life, and
the world was going on very well with him.
Mr. Grissom paused a moment and listened;
then he made up his mind to go in and have
a chat with the young man. He opened
the gate and went up the avenue under the
cedars and Lombardy poplars. A little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
distance from the house he was stopped by
a large mastiff. The great dog made no attempt
to attack him, but majestically barred
the way.</p>

<p>“Squire,” yelled Joe-Bob, “ef you’ll call
off your dog, I’ll turn right ’roun’ an’ go
home an’ never bother you no more.”</p>

<p>“Is that you, Joe-Bob?” exclaimed Mr.
Underwood. “Well, come right on. The
dog won’t trouble you.”</p>

<p>The dog thereupon turned around and
went up the avenue to the house and into
the porch, where he stretched himself out at
full length, Joe-Bob following along at a
discreet distance.</p>

<p>“Come in,” said Underwood heartily;
“I’m glad to see you. Take this large
rocking-chair; you will find it more comfortable
than the smaller one.”</p>

<p>Mr. Grissom sat down and looked cautiously
around to see where the dog was.</p>

<p>“I did come, Squire,” he said, “to see
you on some kinder business, but that dratted
dog has done skeered it clean out ’n me.”</p>

<p>“Prince is a faithful watcher,” said Underwood,
“but he never troubles any one
who is coming straight to the house. Do
you, old fellow?” The dog rapped an answer
on the floor with his tail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Joe-Bob, “I’d as lief be
tore up into giblets, mighty nigh, as to have
my sev’m senses skeered out’n me. What
I’m afeared of now,” he went on, “is that
that dog will jump over the fence some day
an’ ketch old Judge Bascome whilst he’s
a-pirootin’ ’roun’ here a-lookin’ at the old
Place. An’ ef he don’t ketch the Judge,
it’s more’n likely he’ll ketch the Judge’s
gal. I seen both of ’em this very evenin’
whilst I was a-goin’ down town.”</p>

<p>“Was that the Judge?” exclaimed
young Mr. Underwood, with some show of
interest; “and was the lady his daughter?
I heard they had returned.”</p>

<p>“That was jest percisely who it was,”
said Joe-Bob with emphasis. “It wa’n’t nobody
else under the shinin’ sun.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Underwood, “I have
seen them walking by several times. It is
natural they should be interested in the
Place. The old gentleman was born here?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Joe-Bob, “an’ the gal too.
They tell me,” he went on, “that the old
Judge an’ his gal have seed a many ups an’
downs. I reckon they er boun’ fer to feel
lonesome when they come by an’ look at the
prop’ty that use’ to be theirn. I hear tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
that the old Judge is gwine to try an’ see ef
he can’t git it back.”</p>

<p>Francis Underwood said nothing, but sat
gazing out into the moonlight as if in deep
thought.</p>

<p>“I thinks, says I,” continued Joe-Bob,
“that the old Judge’ll have to be lots
pearter ’n he looks to be ef he gits ahead of
Squire Underwood.”</p>

<p>The “Squire” continued to gaze reflectively
down the dim perspective of cedars
and Lombardy poplars. Finally he said:—</p>

<p>“Have a cigar, old man. These are
good ones.”</p>

<p>Joe-Bob took the cigar and lighted it,
handling it very gingerly.</p>

<p>“I ain’t a denyin’ but what they are good,
Squire, but somehow er nuther me an’ these
here fine seegyars don’t gee,” said Joe-Bob,
as he puffed away. “They’re purty toler’ble
nice, but jest about the time I git in the
notion of smokin’ they’re done burnted up,
an’ then ef you ain’t got sev’m or eight
more, it makes you feel mighty lonesome.
Now I’ll smoke this’n’, an’ it’ll sorter put
my teeth on edge fer my pipe, an’ when I
git home I’ll set up an’ have a right nice
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“And so you think,” said Underwood,
speaking as if he had not heard Joe-Bob’s remarks
about the cigar—“and so you think
Judge Bascom has come to buy the old
Place.”</p>

<p>“No, no!” said Joe-Bob, with a quick
deprecatory gesture. “Oh, no, Squire! not
by no means! No, no! I never said them
words. What I did say was that it’s been
talked up an’ down that the old Judge is
a-gwine to try to git his prop’ty back. That’s
what old Major Jimmy Bass said he heard,
an’ I thinks, says I, he’ll have to be monst’us
peart ef he gits ahead of Squire Underwood.
That’s what I said to myself, an’
then I ast old Major Jimmy, says I, what
the Judge would do wi’ the prop’ty arter he
got it, an’ Major Jimmy, he ups an’ says,
says he, that the old Judge would sell it
back to Frank Underwood, says he.”</p>

<p>The young man threw back his head and
laughed heartily, not less at the comical
earnestness of Joe-Bob Grissom than at the
gossip of Major Jimmy Bass.</p>

<p>“It seems, then, that we are going to
have lively times around here,” said Underwood,
by way of comment.</p>

<p>“Yes, siree,” exclaimed Joe-Bob; “that’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
what Major Jimmy Bass allowed. Do you
reckon, Squire,” he continued, lowering his
voice as though the matter was one to be
approached cautiously, “do you reckon,
Squire, they could slip in on you an’ trip
you up wi’ one of ’em writs of arousement
or one of ’em bills of injectment?”</p>

<p>“Not unless they catch me asleep,” replied
Underwood, still laughing. “We get
up very early in the morning on this Place.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Joe-Bob Grissom, “I ain’t
much of a lawyer myself, an’ so I thought
I’d jest drap in an’ tell you the kind of
talk what they’ve been a-rumorin’ ’roun’.
But I’ll tell you what you kin do, Squire.
Ef the wust comes to the wust, you kin make
the old Judge an’ the gal take you along
wi’ the Place. Now them would be my politics.”</p>

<p>With that Joe-Bob gave young Underwood
a nudge in the short ribs, and chuckled
to such an extent that he nearly strangled
himself with cigar smoke.</p>

<p>“I think I would have the best of the
bargain,” said the young man.</p>

<p>“Now you would! you reely would!” exclaimed
Joe-Bob in all seriousness. “I
can’t tell you the time when I ever seed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
likelier gal than that one wi’ the Judge this
evenin’. As we say down here in Georgia,
she’s the top of the pot an’ the pot a-b’ilin’.
I tell you that right pine-blank.”</p>

<p>After a little, Mr. Grissom rose to go.
When Mr. Underwood urged him to sit
longer, he pointed to the sword and belt of
Orion hanging low in the southwest.</p>

<p>“The ell an’ yard are a-makin’ the’r disappearance,”
he said; “an’ ef I stay out
much longer, my old ’oman’ll think I’ve
been a-settin’ up by a jug somewheres. Now
ef you’ll jest hold your dog, Squire, I’ll go
out as peaceful as a lamb.”</p>

<p>“Why, I was just going to propose to
send him down to the big gate with you,”
said young Underwood. “He’ll see you
safely out.”</p>

<p>“No, no, Squire!” exclaimed Joe-Bob,
holding up both hands. “Now don’t do
the like of that. I don’t like too much perliteness
in folks, an’ I know right well I
couldn’t abide it in a dog. No, Squire;
jest hold on to the creetur’ wi’ both hands,
an’ I’ll find my way out. Jest ketch him
by the forefoot. I’ve heard tell before now
that ef you’ll hold a dog by his forefoot he
can’t git loose, an’ nuther kin he bite you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>Long after Mr. Joe-Bob Grissom had
gone home young Francis Underwood sat
in his piazza smoking and thinking. He
had a good deal to think about, too, for he
was perhaps the busiest and the thriftiest
person that Hillsborough had ever seen.
He had a dairy farm stocked with the
choicest strains of Jersey cattle, and he
shipped hundreds of pounds of golden butter
all over the country every week in the
year; he bred Percheron horses for farm-work
and trotting-horses for the road; he
had a flourishing farm on which he raised,
in addition to his own supplies, a hundred
or more bales of cotton every year; he had
a steam saw-mill and cotton-gin; he was a
contractor and builder; and he was also an
active partner in the largest store in Hillsborough.
Moreover he took a lively interest
in the affairs of the town. His energy and
his progressive ideas seemed to be contagious,
for in a few years the sleepy old town
had made tremendous strides, and everything
appeared to move forward with an
air of business—such is the force of a genial
and robust example.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that young Underwood
was somewhat coolly received when he first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
made his appearance in Hillsborough. He
was a New Yorker and therefore a Yankee;
and some of the older people, who were still
grieving over the dire results of the war, as
old people have a right to do, made no concealment
of their prejudices. Their grief
was too bitter to be lightly disposed of.
Perhaps the young man appreciated this
fact, for his sympathies were wonderfully
quick and true. At any rate, he carried
himself as buoyantly and as genially in the
face of prejudice as he did afterwards in the
face of friendship.</p>

<p>The truth is, prejudice could not stand
before him. He had that magnetic personality
which is a more precious possession
than fame or fortune. There was something
attractive even in his restless energy;
he had that heartiness of manner and graciousness
of disposition that are so rare
among men; and, withal, a spirit of independence
that charmed the sturdy-minded
people with whom he cast his lot. It was
not long before the younger generation began
to seek Mr. Underwood out, and after this
the social ice, so to speak, thawed quickly.</p>

<p>In short, young Underwood, by reason of
a strong and an attractive individuality, became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
a very prominent citizen of Hillsborough.
He found time, in the midst of his
own business enterprises, to look after the
interests of the town and the county. One
of his first movements was to organize an
agricultural society which held its meeting
four times a year in different parts of the
county. It was purely a local and native
suggestion, however, that made it incumbent
on the people of the neighborhood where the
Society met to grace the occasion with a feast
in the shape of a barbecue. The first result
of the agricultural society—which still exists,
and which has had a wonderful influence
on the farmers of middle Georgia—was
a county fair, of which Mr. Underwood
was the leading spirit. It may be said, indeed,
that his energy and his money made
the fair possible. And it was a success.
Young Underwood had not only canvassed
the county, but he had “worked it up in
the newspapers,” as the phrase goes, and
it tickled the older citizens immensely to
see the dailies in the big cities of Atlanta,
Macon, and Savannah going into rhetorical
raptures over their fair.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Francis Underwood,
charged with the fiery energy of a modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
American, found it a much easier matter to
establish himself in the good graces of the
people of Hillsborough and the surrounding
country than did Judge Bascom when he returned
to his old home with his lovely daughter.
Politically speaking, he had committed
the unpardonable sin when he accepted office
under what was known as the carpet-bag
government. It was an easy matter—thus
the argument ran—to forgive and respect
an enemy, but it was hardly possible
to forgive a man who had proved false to
his people and all their traditions—who
had, in fact, “sold his birthright for a mess
of pottage,” to quote the luminous language
employed by Colonel Bolivar Blasingame in
discussing the return of Judge Bascom. It
is due to Colonel Blasingame to say that he
did not allude to the sale of the Bascom
Place, but to the fact that Judge Bascom
had drawn a salary from the State treasury
while the Republicans were in power in
Georgia.</p>

<p>This was pretty much the temper of the
older people of Hillsborough even in 1876.
They had no bitter prejudices against the
old Judge; they were even tolerant and
kindly; but they made it plain to him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
he was regarded in a new light, and from a
new standpoint. He was made to feel that
his old place among them must remain vacant;
that the old intimacies were not to
be renewed. But this was the price that
Judge Bascom was willing to pay for the
privilege of spending his last days within
sight of the old homestead. He made no
complaints, nor did he signify by word or
sign, even to his daughter, that everything
was not as it used to be.</p>

<p>As for the daughter, she was in blissful
ignorance of the situation. She was a
stranger among strangers, and so was not
affected by the lack of sociability on the part
of the townspeople—if, indeed, there was
any lack so far as she was concerned. The
privations she endured in common with her
father were not only sufficient to correct all
notions of vanity or self-conceit, but they
had given her a large experience of life;
they had broadened her views and enlarged
her sympathies, so that with no sacrifice of
the qualities of womanly modesty and gentleness
she had grown to be self-reliant.
She attracted all who came within range of
her sweet influence, and it was not long before
she had broken down all the barriers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
that prejudice against her father might have
placed in her way. She established a primary
school, and what with her duties there
and with her music-class she soon had as
much as she could do, and her income from
these sources was sufficient to support herself
and her father in a modest way; but it
was not sufficient to carry out her father’s
plans, and this fact distressed her no little.</p>

<p>Sometimes Judge Bascom, sitting in the
narrow veranda of the little house they occupied,
would suddenly arouse himself, as if
from a doze, and exclaim:—</p>

<p>“We must save money, daughter; we
must save money and buy the old Place
back. It is ours. We must have it; we
must save money.” And sometimes, in the
middle of the night, he would go to his
daughter’s bedside, stroke her hair, and say
in a whisper:—</p>

<p>“We are not saving enough money, daughter;
we must save more. We must buy
the old Place back. We must save it from
ruin.”</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>There was one individual in Hillsborough
who did not give the cold shoulder to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Judge Bascom on his return, and that was
the negro Jesse, who had been bought by
Major Jimmy Bass some years before the
war from Merriwether Bascom, a cousin of
the Judge. Jesse made no outward demonstration
of welcome; he was more practical
than that. He merely went to his old master
with whom he had been living since he
became free, and told him that he was going
to find employment elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Why, what in the nation!” exclaimed
Major Bass. “Why, what’s the matter,
Jess?”</p>

<p>The very idea was preposterous. In the
Bass household the negro was almost indispensable.
He was in the nature of a piece
of furniture that holds its own against all
fashions and fills a place that nothing else
can fill.</p>

<p>“Dey ain’t nothin’ ’t all de matter, Marse
Maje. I des took it in my min’, like, dat I’d
go off some’r’s roun’ town en set up fer myse’f,”
said Jesse, scratching his head in a
dubious way. He felt very uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Has anybody hurt your feelin’s, Jess?”</p>

<p>“No, suh! Lord, no, suh, dat dey ain’t!”
exclaimed Jesse, with the emphasis of astonishment.
“Nobody ain’t pester me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ain’t your Miss Sarah been rushin’ you
roun’ too lively fer to suit your notions?”</p>

<p>“No, suh.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t she been a-quarrelin’ after you
about your work?”</p>

<p>“No, Marse Maje; she ain’t say a word.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, Jess, what in the name of
common sense are you gwine off fer?” The
major wanted to argue the matter.</p>

<p>“I got it in my min’, Marse Maje, but I
dunno ez I kin git it out straight.” Jesse
leaned his cane against the house, and
placed his hat on the steps, as if preparing
for a lengthy and elaborate explanation.
“Now den, hit look dis way ter me, des like
I’m gwine ter tell you. I ain’t nothin’ but
a nigger, I know dat mighty well, en nobody
don’t hafter tell me. I’m a nigger, en you
a white man. You’re a-settin’ up dar in de
peazzer, en I’m a-stan’in’ down yer on de
groun’. I been wid you a long time; you
treat me well, you gimme plenty vittles, en
you pay me up when you got de money, en I
hustle roun’ en do de bes’ I kin in de house
en in de gyarden. Dat de way it been
gwine on; bofe un us feel like it all sati’factual.
Bimeby it come over me dat maybe I
kin do mo’ work dan what I been a-doin’ en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
git mo’ money. Hit work roun’ in my min’
dat I better be layin’ up somepin’ n’er fer
de ole ’oman en de chillun.”</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed Major Bass with a
snort. It was all he could say.</p>

<p>“En den ag’in,” Jesse went on, “one er
de ole fambly done come back ’long wid his
daughter. Marse Briscoe Bascom en Miss
Mildred dey done come back, en dey ain’t
got nobody fer ter he’p um out no way; en
my ole ’oman she say dat ef I got any fambly
feelin’ I better go dar whar Marse Briscoe
is.”</p>

<p>For some time Major Jimmy Bass sat
silent. He was shocked and stunned. Finally
Jesse picked up his hat and cane and
started to go. As he brushed his hat with
his coat-sleeve his old master saw that he
was rigged out in his Sunday clothes. As
he moved away the major called him:—</p>

<p>“Oh, Jess!”</p>

<p>“Suh?”</p>

<p>“I allers knowed you was a durned fool,
Jess, but I never did know before that you
was the durndest fool in the universal
world.”</p>

<p>Jesse made no reply, and the major went
into the house. When he told his wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
about Jesse’s departure, that active-minded
and sharp-tongued lady was very angry.</p>

<p>“Indeed, and I’m glad of it,” she exclaimed
as she poured out the major’s coffee;
“I’m truly glad of it. For twenty-five
years that nigger has been laying around
here doing nothing, and we a-paying him.
But for pity’s sake I’d ’a’ drove him off the
lot long ago. You mayn’t believe it, but
that nigger is ready and willing to eat his
own weight in vittles every week the Lord
sends. I ain’t sorry he’s gone, but I’m
sorry I didn’t have a chance to give him a
piece of my mind. Now, don’t you go to
blabbing it around, like you do everything
else, that Jesse has gone and left us to go
with old Briscoe Bascom.”</p>

<p>Major Bass said he wouldn’t, and he
didn’t, and that is the reason he expressed
surprise when Joe-Bob Grissom informed
him that Jesse was waiting on the old Judge
and his daughter. Major Jimmy was talkative
and fond of gossip, but he had too
much respect for his wife’s judgment and
discretion to refuse to toe the mark, even
when it was an imaginary one.</p>

<p>The Bascom family had no claim whatever
on Jesse, but he had often heard his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
mother and other negroes boasting over that
they had once belonged to the Bascoms, and
fondness for the family was the result of
both tradition and instinct. He had that undefined
and undefinable respect for people of
quality that is one of the virtues, or possibly
one of the failings, of human nature. The
nearest approach to people of quality, so far
as his experience went, was to be found in
the Bascom family, and he had never forgotten
that he had belonged to an important
branch of it. He held it as a sort of distinction.
Feeling thus, it is no wonder that
he was ready to leave a comfortable home
at Major Jimmy Bass’s for the privilege of
attaching himself and his fortunes to those
of the Judge and his daughter. Jesse made
up his mind to take this step as soon as the
Bascoms returned to Hillsborough, and he
made no delay in carrying out his intentions.</p>

<p>Early one morning, not long after Judge
Bascom and his daughter had settled themselves
in the modest little house which they
had selected because the rent was low, Mildred
heard some one cutting wood in the
yard. Opening her window blinds a little,
she saw that the axe was wielded by a stalwart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
negro a little past middle age. Her
father was walking up and down the sidewalk
on the outside with his hands behind
him, and seemed to be talking to himself.</p>

<p>A little while afterwards Mildred went
into the kitchen. She found a fire burning
in the stove, and everything in noticeably
good order, but the girl she had employed
to help her about the house was nowhere to
be seen. Whereupon the young lady called
her—</p>

<p>“Elvira!”</p>

<p>At this the negro dropped his axe and
went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Howdy, Mistiss?”</p>

<p>“Have you seen Elvira?” Mildred asked.</p>

<p>“Yes’m, she wuz hangin’ roun’ yer when
I come roun’ dis mornin’. I went in dar,
ma’m, en I see how de kitchen wuz all
messed up, en den I sont her off. She de
mos’ no ’countest nigger gal what I ever
laid my two eyes on. I’m name’ Jesse,
ma’m, en I use’ ter b’long ter de Bascom
fambly when I wuz a boy. Is you ready
fer breakfus, Mistiss?”</p>

<p>“Has my father—has Judge Bascom
employed you?” Mildred asked. Jesse
laughed as though enjoying a good joke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“No ’m, dat he ain’t! I des come my
own se’f, kaze I know’d in reason you wuz
gwine ter be in needance er somebody.
Lord, no ’m, none er de Bascoms don’t
hafter hire me, ma’m.”</p>

<p>“And who told you to send Elvira
away?” Mildred inquired, half vexed and
half amused.</p>

<p>“Nobody ain’t tell me, ma’m,” Jesse replied.
“When I come she wuz des settin’
in dar by de stove noddin’, en de whole
kitchen look like it been tored up by a harrycane.
I des shuck her up, I did, en tell
her dat if dat de way she gwine do, she
better go ’long back en stay wid her mammy.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are very meddlesome,” said
Mildred. “I don’t understand you at all.
Who is going to cook breakfast?”</p>

<p>“Mistiss, I done tell you dat breakfus is
all ready en a-waitin’,” exclaimed Jesse in
an injured tone. “I made dat gal set de
table, en dey ain’t nothin’ ter do but put de
vittles on it.”</p>

<p>It turned out to be a very good breakfast,
too, such as it was. Jesse thought while he
was preparing it that it was a very small
allowance for two hearty persons. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
secret of its scantiness cropped out while the
Judge and his daughter were eating.</p>

<p>“These biscuits are very well cooked.
But there are too many of them. My
daughter, we must pinch and save; it will
only be for a little while. We must have the
old Place back; we must rake and scrape,
and save money and buy it back. And this
coffee is very good, too,” he went on; “it
has quite the old flavor. I thought the girl
was too young, but she’s a good cook—a
very good cook indeed.”</p>

<p>Jesse, who had taken his stand behind
the Judge’s chair, arrayed in a snow-white
apron, moved his body uneasily from one
foot to the other. Mildred, glad to change
the conversation, told her father about
Jesse.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” said Judge Bascom, in his
kindly, patronizing way; “I saw him in the
yard. And he used to belong to the Bascoms?
Well, well, it must have been a
long time ago. This is Jesse behind me?
Stand out there, Jesse, and let me look at
you. Ah, yes, a likely negro; a very likely
negro indeed. And what Bascom did
you belong to, Jesse? Merriwether Bascom!
Why, to be sure; why, certainly!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the Judge continued with as much animation
as his feebleness would admit of.
“Why, of course, Merriwether Bascom.
Well, well, I remember him distinctly.
A rough-and-tumble sort of man he was,
fighting, gambling, horse-racing, always on
the wing. A good man at bottom, but wild.
And so you belonged to Merriwether Bascom?
Well, boy, once a Bascom always a
Bascom. We’ll have the old Place back,
Jesse, we’ll have it back: but we must
pinch ourselves; we must save.”</p>

<p>Thus the old Judge rambled on in his
talk. But no matter what the subject, no
matter how far his memory and his experiences
carried him away from the present, he
was sure to return to the old Place at last.
He must have it back. Every thought,
every idea, was subordinate to this. He
brooded over it and talked of it waking, and
he dreamed of it sleeping. It was the one
thought that dominated every other. Money
must be saved, the old Place must be
bought, and to that end everything must
tend. The more his daughter economized
the more he urged her to economize. His
earnestness and enthusiasm impressed and
influenced the young girl in a larger measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
than she would have been willing to acknowledge,
and unconsciously she found
herself looking forward to the day when her
father and herself would be able to call the
Bascom Place their own. In the Judge the
thought was the delusion of old age, in the
maiden it was the dream of youth; and
pardonable, perhaps, in both.</p>

<p>Their hopes and desires running thus in
one channel, they loved to wander of an evening
in the neighborhood of the old Place—it
was just in the outskirts of the town—and
long for the time when they should take
possession of their home. On these occasions
Mildred, by way of interesting her
father, would suggest changes to be made.</p>

<p>“The barn is painted red,” she would
say. “I think olive green would be prettier.”</p>

<p>“No,” the Judge would reply; “we will
have the barn removed. It was not there in
my time. It is an innovation. We will have
it removed a mile away from the house. We
will make many changes. There are hundreds
of acres in the meadow yonder that
ought to be in cotton. In my time we tried
to kill grass, but this man is doing his best
to propagate it. Look at that field of Bermuda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
there. Two years of hard work will
be required to get the grass out.”</p>

<p>Once while the Judge and his daughter
were passing by the old Place they met
Prince, the mastiff, in the road. The great
dog looked at the young lady with kindly
eyes, and expressed his approval by wagging
his tail. Then he approached and allowed
her to fondle his lionlike head, and walked
by her side, responding to her talk in a
dumb but eloquent way. Prince evidently
thought that the young lady and her father
were going in the avenue gate and to the
house, for when they got nearly opposite,
the dog trotted on ahead, looking back occasionally,
as if by that means to extend them
an invitation and to assure them that they
were welcome. At the gate he stopped and
turned around, and seeing that the fair lady
and the old gentleman were going by, he
dropped his bulky body on the ground in a
disconsolate way and watched them as they
passed down the street.</p>

<p>The next afternoon Prince made it a point
to watch for the young lady; and when she
and her father appeared in sight he ran to
meet them and cut up such unusual capers,
barking and running around, that his master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
went down the avenue to see what the
trouble was. Mr. Underwood took off his
hat as Judge Bascom and his daughter drew
near.</p>

<p>“This is Judge Bascom, I presume,” he
said. “My name is Underwood. I am
glad to meet you.”</p>

<p>“This is my daughter, Mr. Underwood,”
said the Judge, bowing with great dignity.</p>

<p>“My dog has paid you a great compliment,
Miss Bascom,” said Francis Underwood.
“He makes few friends, and I have never
before seen him sacrifice his dignity to his
enthusiasm.”</p>

<p>“I feel highly flattered by his attentions,”
said Mildred, laughing. “I have read somewhere,
or heard it said, that the instincts of
a little child and a dog are unerring.”</p>

<p>“I imagine,” said the Judge, in his dignified
way, “that instinct has little to do with
the matter. I prefer to believe”—He
paused a moment, looked at Underwood, and
laid his hand on the young man’s stalwart
shoulder. “Did you know, sir,” he went
on, “that this place, all these lands, once
belonged to me?” His dignity had vanished,
his whole attitude changed. The
pathos in his voice, which was suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
rather than expressed, swept away whatever
astonishment Francis Underwood might have
felt. The young man looked at the Judge’s
daughter and their eyes met. In that one
glance, transitory though it was, he found
his cue; in her lustrous eyes, proud yet appealing,
he read a history of trouble and
sacrifice.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Underwood replied, in a matter-of-fact
way. “I knew the place once belonged
to you, and I have been somewhat
proud of the fact. We still call it the Bascom
Place, you know.”</p>

<p>“I should think so!” exclaimed the
Judge, bridling up a little; “I should think
so! Pray what else could it be called?”</p>

<p>“Well, it might have been called Grasslands,
you know, or The Poplars, but somehow
the old name seemed to suit it best. I
like to think of it as the Bascom Place.”</p>

<p>“You are right, sir,” said the Judge with
emphasis; “you are right, sir. It is the
Bascom Place. All the powers of earth
cannot strip us of our name.”</p>

<p>Again Underwood looked at the young
girl, and again he read in her shining but
apprehensive eyes the answer he should
make.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have been compelled to add some conveniences—I
will not call them improvements—and
I have made some repairs, but
I have tried to preserve the main and familiar
features of the Place.”</p>

<p>“But the barn there; that is not where
it should be. It should be a mile away—on
the creek.”</p>

<p>“That would improve appearances, no
doubt; but if you were to get out at four or
five o’clock in the morning and see to the
milking of twelve or fifteen cows, I dare say
you would wish the barn even nearer than
it is.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I suppose so,” responded the
Judge; “yes, no doubt. But it was not
there in my time—not in my time.”</p>

<p>“I have some very fine cows,” Underwood
went on. “Won’t you go in and look at
them? I think they would interest Miss
Bascom, and my sister would be glad to meet
her. Won’t you go in, sir, and look at the
old house?”</p>

<p>The Judge turned his pale and wrinkled
face towards his old home.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, “not now. I thank you
very much. I—somehow—no, sir, I cannot
go now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>His hand shook as he raised it to his face,
and his lips trembled as he spoke.</p>

<p>“Let us go home, daughter,” he said after
a while. “We have walked far enough.”
He bowed to young Underwood, and Mildred
bade him good-bye with a troubled smile.</p>

<p>Prince went with them a little way down
the street. He walked by the side of the
lady, and her pretty hand rested lightly on
the dog’s massive head. It was a beautiful
picture, Underwood thought, as he stood
watching them pass out of sight.</p>

<p>“You are a lucky dog,” he said to Prince
when the latter came back, “but you don’t
appreciate your privileges. If you did you
would have gone home with that lovely
woman.” Prince wagged his tail, but it is
doubtful if he fully understood the remark.</p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>One Sunday morning, as Major Jimmy
Bass was shaving himself, he heard a knock
at the back door. The major had his coat
and waistcoat off and his suspenders were
hanging around his hips. He was applying
the lather for the last time, and the knocking
was so sudden and unexpected that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
rubbed the shaving-brush in one of his eyes.
He began to make some remarks which, however
appropriate they may have been to the
occasion, could not be reported here with
propriety. But in the midst of his indignant
monologue he remembered that the
knocking might have proceeded from some
of Mrs. Bass’s lady friends, who frequently
made a descent on the premises in that direction
for the purpose of borrowing a cupful
of sugar or coffee in a social way. These
considerations acted as powerful brakes on
the conversation that Major Bass was carrying
on with some imaginary foe. Holding
a towel to his smarting eye, he peeped from
his room door and looked down the hall.
The back door was open, but he could see
no one.</p>

<p>“Who was that knocking?” he cried.
“I’ll go one eye on you anyways.”</p>

<p>“’T ain’t nobody but me, Marse Maje,”
came the response from the door.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Jess?” exclaimed the major.
“Well, pleg-take your hide to the pleg-taked
nation! A little more an’ you’d ’a’ made
me cut my th’oat from year to year; an’ as
it is, I’ve jest about got enough soap in my
eye fer to do a day’s washin’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is you shavin’ yourse’f, Marse Maje?”
asked Jesse, diplomatically.</p>

<p>“That I am,” replied the major with emphasis.
“I allers was independent of white
folks, an’ sence you pulled up your stakes
an’ took up wi’ the quality I’m about independent
of the niggers. An’ it’s mighty
quare to me,” the major went on, “that
you’d leave your high an’ mighty people
long enough fer to come a-bangin’ an’ makin’
me put out my eyes. Why, ef I’d ’a’ had
my razor out, I’ll be boun’ you’d made me
cut my th’oat, an’ much good may it ’a’ done
you.”</p>

<p>“Name er goodness, Marse Maje,” protested
Jesse, “what make you go on dat
a-way? Ef I’d ’a’ knowed you wuz busy
in dar I’d ’a’ set out in de sun en waited
twel you got thoo.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the major in a sarcastic but
somewhat mollified tone, “you’d ’a’ sot out
there an’ got to noddin’, an’ then bimeby
your Miss Sarah would ’a’ come along an’
ketched you there, an’ I’ll be boun’ she’d
’a’ lammed you wi’ a chunk of wood; bekaze
she don’t ’low no loafin’ in the back yard
sence you been gone. I don’t know what
you come fer,” the major continued, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
wiping the lather out of his eye, “an’ nuther
do I keer; but sence you are here you kin
come in an’ finish shavin’ me, fer to pay fer
the damage you’ve done.”</p>

<p>Jesse was apparently overjoyed to find
that he could be of some service. He bustled
around in the liveliest manner, and was
soon mowing the major’s fat face with the
light but firm touch for which he was noted.
As he shaved he talked.</p>

<p>“Marse Maje,” he said, “does you know
what I come fer dis mornin’?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been tryin’ to think,” replied the
major; “but I couldn’t tell you ef I was
a-gwine to be hung fer it. You are up to
some devilment, I know mighty well, but I
wish’t I may die ef I’ve got any idee what
it is.”</p>

<p>“Now, Marse Maje, what make you talk
dat’a’way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know you, Jess, an’ I’ve been
a-knowin’ you a mighty long time. Your
Miss Sarah mayn’t know you, Jess, but I
know you from the groun’ all the way up.”</p>

<p>Jesse laughed. He was well aware that
the major’s wife was the knowing one of
that family. He had waited until that excellent
lady had issued from the house on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
her way to church, and it was not until she
was out of sight that he thought it safe to
call on the major. Even now, after he had
found the major alone, the negro was somewhat
doubtful as to the propriety of explaining
the nature of his business; but the old
man was inquisitive.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Jess!” the major went on, after
pausing long enough to have the corner of
his mouth shaved—“oh, yes! I know you,
an’ I know you’ve got somethin’ on your
min’ right now. Spit it out.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you de trufe, Marse
Maje,” said Jesse, after hesitating for some
time; “I tell you de Lord’s trufe, I come
yer atter somepin’ ter eat.”</p>

<p>Major Bass caught the negro by the arm,
pushed the razor carefully out of the way,
and sat bolt upright in the chair.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to stan’ up there, you triflin’
rascal,” the major exclaimed, “an’ tell
me, right before my face an’ eyes, that
you’ve come a-sneaking back here atter vittles?
Whyn’t you stay where the vittles
was?” Major Bass was really indignant.</p>

<p>“Wait, Marse Maje; des gimme time,”
said Jesse, nervously strapping the razor on
the palm of his hand. “Des gimme time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
Marse Maje. You fly up so, suh, dat you
git me all mixed up wid myse’f. I come
atter vittles, dat’s de Lord’s trufe; but I
ain’t come atter ’em fer myse’f. Nigger
like me don’t stay hongry long roun’ whar
folks know um like dey does me.”</p>

<p>“Well, who in the name of reason sent
you, then?” asked the major.</p>

<p>“Nobody ain’t sont me, suh,” said Jesse.</p>

<p>“Well, who do you want em’ fer?” insisted
the major.</p>

<p>“Marse Judge Bascom en Miss Mildred,”
replied Jesse solemnly.</p>

<p>Major Jimmy Bass fell back in his chair
in a state of collapse, overcome by his astonishment.</p>

<p>“<em>Well!</em>” he exclaimed, as soon as he
could catch his breath. “Ef this don’t beat
the Jews an’ the Gentiles, the Scribes an’
the Pharisees, then I ain’t a-settin’ here.
Did they tell you to come to this house fer
vittles?”</p>

<p>“No, suh; <em>dat</em> dey ain’t—<em>dat</em> dey ain’t!
Ef Miss Mildred wuz ter know I went anywhar
on dis kin’ er errun’ she’d mighty
nigh have a fit.”</p>

<p>“Well, <em>well</em>, <em class="smcapuc">WELL</em>!” snorted the major.</p>

<p>“I des come my own se’f,” Jesse went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
on. He would have begun shaving again,
but the major waved him away. “Look
like I ’bleege’ ter come. You’d ’a’ come
yo’se’f, Marse Maje, druther dan see dem
folks pe’sh deyse’f ter deff. Dey got money,
but Marse Judge Bascom got de idee dat
dey hafter save it all fer ter buy back de
ole Place. Dey pinch deyse’f day in en day
out, en yistiddy when Miss Mildred say she
gwine buy somepin’ fer Sunday, Marse
Judge Bascom he say no; he ’low dat dey
mus’ save en pinch en buy back de ole
home. I done year him say dat twel it
make me plum sick. An’ dar dey is naturally
starvin’ deyse’f.</p>

<p>“Miss Mildred,” continued Jesse, “got
idee dat her pa know what he talkin’ ’bout;
but twix’ you en me, Marse Maje, dat ole
man done about lose his min’. He ain’t so
mighty much older dan what you is, but he
mighty feeble in his limbs, en he mighty
flighty in his head. He talk funny, now,
en he don’t talk ’bout nothin’ skacely but
buyin’ back the ole Place.”</p>

<p>“Jess,” said Major Bass in the smooth,
insinuating tone that the negro knew so well,
and that he had learned to fear, “ain’t I
allers treated you right? Ain’t I allers
done the clean thing by you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, Marse Maje, you is,” said the negro
with emphasis.</p>

<p>“Well, then, Jess, what in the name of
Moses do you want to come roun’ me wi’
such a tale as this? Don’t you know I
know you clean through? Whyn’t you
come right out an’ say you want the vittles
fer yourself? What is the use whippin’ the
devil ’roun’ the stump?”</p>

<p>“Marse Maje,” said Jesse, solemnly,
“I’m a-tellin’ you de Lord’s trufe.” By
this time he had begun to shave the major
again.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Major Bass, after a pause,
during which he seemed to be thinking,
“suppos’n’ I was to let myself be took in by
your tale, an’ suppos’n’ I was to give you
some vittles, what have you got to put ’em
in?”</p>

<p>“I got a basket out dar, Marse Maje,”
said Jesse, cheerfully. “I brung it a purpose.”</p>

<p>“Why, tooby shore, tooby shore!” exclaimed
the major, sarcastically. “Ef you
was as forehanded as you is fore-thoughted
you wouldn’t be a-runnin’ roun’ beggin’ vittles
from han’ to mouth. But sence you are
here you’d better make haste; bekaze ef your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Miss Sarah comes back from church and
ketches you here, she’ll kick up a purty
rippit.”</p>

<p>The major was correct. As he and Jesse
went into the pantry Mrs. Bass entered the
front door. Flinging her bonnet and mantilla
on a bed, she went to the back porch
for a drink of water. The major heard her
coming through the hallway, and, by a swift
gesture of his hand, cautioned Jesse to be
quiet.</p>

<p>“I’ll vow if the place ain’t left to take
care of itself,” Mrs. Bass was saying.
“Doors all open, chickens in the dining-room,
cat licking the churn-dasher, and I’ll
bet my existence that not a drop of fresh
water has been put in the house-bucket
since I left this morning. Everything gone
to rack and ruin. I can’t say my prayers
in peace at home, and if I go to church one
Sunday in a month there ain’t no satisfaction
in the sermon, because I know everything’s
at loose ends on this whole blessed
place. And if you’d go up the street right
now, you’d find Mr. Bass a-setting up there
at the tavern with the other loafers, a-giggling
and a-snickering and a-dribbling at
the mouth like one possessed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The major, in the pantry, winced visibly
at this picture drawn true to life, and as he
attempted to change his position he knocked
a tin vessel from one of the shelves. He
caught at it, and it fell to the floor with a
loud crash.</p>

<p>“The Lord have mercy!” exclaimed
Mrs. Bass. “Is Satan and all his imps in
the pantry, a-tearing down and a-smashing
up things?” Not being a timid woman,
she hastened to investigate. The sight she
saw in the pantry struck her speechless. In
one corner stood the major, holding up one
foot, as if he was afraid of breaking something,
and vainly trying to smile. In
another corner stood Jesse, so badly frightened
that very little could be seen of his
face except the whites of his eyes. The
tableau was a comical one. Mrs. Bass did
not long remain speechless.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bass!” she exclaimed, “what under
the shining sun are you doing colloguing
with niggers in my pantry? If you
want to collogue with niggers, why, in the
name of common sense, don’t you take ’em
out to the barn? What are you doing in
there, anyhow? For mercy’s sake! have
you gone stark-natural crazy? And if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
ain’t, what brand-new caper are you trying
to cut up?”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so loud, Sarah,” said the major,
wiping the cold perspiration from his
face. “All the neighbors’ll hear you.”</p>

<p>“And why shouldn’t they hear me?” exclaimed
Mrs. Bass. “What could be worse
than for me to come home from church in
broad daylight and find you penned up in
my pantry, arm-in-arm with a nigger?
What business have you got with niggers
that you have to take ’em into my pantry to
collogue with ’em? I’d a heap rather
you’d ’a’ taken ’em in the parlor—a heap
rather.”</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Bass’s eyes fell on the basket
Jesse had in his hand, and this added to her
indignation.</p>

<p>“I believe in my soul,” she went on,
“that you are stealing the meat and bread
out of your own mouth to feed that nigger.
If you ain’t, what is the basket for?”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, Sarah, don’t you go on so;
you’ll make yourself the laughin’-stock of
the town,” said the major in a conciliatory
tone.</p>

<p>“And what’ll you be?” continued Mrs.
Bass, relentlessly; “what’ll you be—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
honeyin’ up with buck niggers in my pantry
in the broad open daytime? Maybe you’ll
have the manners to introduce me to your
pardner. Who is he, anyhow?” Then
Mrs. Bass turned her attention to the negro.</p>

<p>“Come out of my pantry, you nasty, trifling
rascal! Who are you?”</p>

<p>“’T ain’t nobody but me, Miss Sa’ah,”
said Jesse as he issued forth.</p>

<p>“You!” she exclaimed. “You are the
nigger that was too biggity to stay with ’em
that raised you up and took care of you, and
now you come back and try to steal their
bread and meat! Well! I know the end of
the world ain’t so mighty far off.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Bass sank into a chair, exhausted by
her indignation. Then the major took the
floor, so to say, and showed that if he could
be frightened by his wife, he could also, at the
proper time, show that he had a will of his
own. He explained the situation at some
length, and with an emphasis that carried
conviction with it. He made no mention of
Jesse in his highly colored narrative, but
left his wife to infer that while she was at
church praying for peace of mind and not
having her prayers answered to any great
extent, he was at home engaged in works of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
practical charity. Nothing could have been
finer than the major’s air of injured innocence,
unless it was Jesse’s attitude of helpless
and abandoned humiliation. The result
of it was that Mrs. Bass filled the basket
with the best she had in the house, and
Jesse went home happy.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>As for the Bascoms, they seemed to be
getting along comfortably in spite of the
harrowing story that Jesse had told to Major
Jimmy Bass and to others. As a matter
of fact, the shrewd negro had purposely
exaggerated the condition of affairs in the
Bascom household. He had an idea that
the fare they lived on was too common and
cheap for the representatives of such a
grand family, forgetting, or not knowing,
the privations they had passed through.
The Judge insisted on the most rigid economy,
and Mildred was at one with him in
this. She was familiar with the necessity
for it, but she could see that her father was
anxious to push it to unmeasurable lengths.
It never occurred to her, however, that her
father’s morbid anxiety to repossess the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Bascom Place was rapidly taking the shape
of mania. This desire on the part of Judge
Bascom was a part of his daughter’s life.
She had heard it expressed in various ways
ever since she could remember, and it was a
part, not merely of her experience, but of
her growth and development. She had
heard the matter discussed so many times
that it seemed to her nothing but natural
that her father should one day realize the
dream of his later years and reoccupy the
old Place as proprietor.</p>

<p>Judge Bascom had no other thought than
this. As he grew older and feebler, the desire
became more ardent and overpowering.
While his daughter was teaching her school,
with which she had made quite a success,
the Judge would be planning improvements
to be added to his old home when he should
own it again. Not a day passed—unless,
indeed, the weather was stormy—that he
did not walk in the neighborhood of the old
Place. Sometimes he would go with his
daughter, sometimes he would go alone, but
it was observed by those who came to be interested
in his comings and goings that he
invariably refused to accept the invitation
of Mr. Underwood to enter the house or to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
inspect the improvements that had been
made. He persisted in remaining on the
outside of the domain, content to wait for
the day when he could enter as proprietor.
He was willing to accept the position of
spectator, but he was not willing to be a
guest.</p>

<p>The culmination came one fine day in the
fall, and it was so sudden and so peculiar
that it took Hillsborough completely by
surprise, and gave the people food for gossip
for a long time afterwards. The season
was hesitating as to whether summer should
return or winter should be introduced.
There was a hint of winter in the crisp
morning breezes, but the world seemed to
float summerwards in the glimmering haze
that wrapped the hills in the afternoons.
On one of these fine mornings Judge Bascom
rose and dressed himself. His daughter
heard him humming a tune as he walked
about the room, and she observed also, with
inward satisfaction, that his movements were
brisker than usual. Listening a little attentively,
she heard him talking to himself, and
presently she heard him laugh. This was
such an unusual occurrence that she was
moved to knock at his door. He responded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
with a cheery “Come in!” Mildred found
him shaved and dressed, and she saw that
there was a great change in his appearance.
His cheeks, usually so wan and white, were
flushed a little and his eyes were bright.
He smiled as Mildred entered, and exclaimed
in a tone that she had not heard for
years:—</p>

<p>“Good-morning, my daughter! And how
do you find yourself this morning?”</p>

<p>It was the old manner she used to admire
so when she was a slip of a girl—a manner
that was a charming combination of dignity
and affection.</p>

<p>“Why, father!” she exclaimed, “you
must be feeling better. You have positively
grown younger in a night.”</p>

<p>The Judge laughed until his eyes sparkled.
“Yes, my dear, I am feeling very well
indeed. I never felt better. I am happy,
quite happy. Everything has been made
clear to me. I am going to-day to transact
some business that has been troubling me
a long time. I shall arrange it all to-day—yes,
to-day.”</p>

<p>The change that had come over her father
was such a relief to Mildred that she asked
him no questions. Now, as always, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
trusted to his judgment and his experience.
Jesse, however, was more critical. He
watched the Judge furtively and shook his
head.</p>

<p>“Mistiss,” he said to Mildred when he
found an opportunity, “did you shave master?”</p>

<p>“Why, what a ridiculous question!” she
exclaimed. “How could I shave him? It
makes me shiver merely to touch the razors.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mistiss,” Jesse insisted, “ef I
ain’t shave him, en you ain’t shave him, den
who de name er goodness is done gone en
done it?”</p>

<p>“He shaved himself, of course,” Mildred
said. “He is very much better this morning.
I noticed it the moment I saw him. I
should think you could see it yourself.”</p>

<p>“I seed somepin’ nuther wuz de matter,”
said Jesse. “Somepin’ ’bleege’ ter be de
matter when I put him ter bed las’ night
des like he wuz a baby, ma’m, en now yer he
is gwine roun’ des ez spry ez de nex’ one.
Yessum, somepin’ ’bleege’ ter be de matter.
Yistiddy his han’s wuz shakin’ same like he
got de polzy, ma’m, en now yer he is shavin’
hisse’f; dat what rack my min’.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I hope you are glad he is so well,
Jesse,” said Mildred in an injured tone.</p>

<p>“Oh, yessum,” said Jesse, scratching his
head. “Lor’, yessum. Dey ain’t nobody
no gladder dan what I is; but it come on
me so sudden, ma’m, dat it sorter skeer me.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t frighten me,” said Mildred.
“It makes me very happy.”</p>

<p>“Yessum,” replied Jesse deferentially.
He made no further comment; but after
Mildred had gone to attend to her school
duties he made it his business to keep an
eye on the Judge, and the closer the negro
watched, the more forcibly was he struck
by the great change that a night had made
in the old man.</p>

<p>“I hear talk ’bout folks bein’ conjured
inter sickness,” Jesse said to himself, “but
I ain’t never hear talk ’bout dey bein’ conjured
so dey git well.”</p>

<p>Certainly a great change had come over
Judge Bascom. He stood firmly on his feet
once more. He held his head erect, as in
the old days, and when he talked to Jesse
his tone was patronizing and commanding,
instead of querulous and complaining. He
seemed to be very fastidious about his appearance.
After Mildred had gone to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
school, Jesse was called in to brush the
Judge’s hat and coat and to polish his shoes.
The Judge watched this process with great
interest, and talked to the negro in his
blandest manner. This was not so surprising
to Jesse as the fact that the Judge persisted
in calling him Wesley; Wesley was
the Judge’s old body-servant who had been
dead for twenty years. It was Wesley this
and Wesley that so long as Jesse was in
the room, and once the Judge asked how
long before the carriage would be ready.
The negro parried this question, but he remembered
it. He was sorely puzzled an
hour afterwards, however, when Judge Bascom
called him and said:—</p>

<p>“Wesley, tell Jordan he need not bring
the carriage around for me. I will walk.
Jordan can bring your mistress when she is
ready.”</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed Jesse, when the Judge
disappeared in the house, “dis bangs me!
What de name er goodness put de ole man
Jerd’n in his min’, which he died endurance
er de war? It’s all away beyant me. Miss
Mildred oughter be yer wid her pa right
now, yit, ef I go atter her, dey ain’t no
tellin’ what he gwine do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>Jess cut an armful of wood, and then
made a pretense of washing dishes, going
from the kitchen to the dining-room several
times. More than once he stopped to listen,
but he could hear nothing. After a while
he made bold to peep into the sitting-room.
There was nobody there. He went into the
Judge’s bedroom; it was empty. Then he
called—“Marster! oh, Marster!” but there
was no reply. Jess was in a quandary. He
was not alarmed, but he was uneasy.</p>

<p>“Ef I run en tell Miss Mildred dat Marster
done gone som’ers,” he said to himself,
“she’ll des laugh en say I ain’t got no
sense; en I don’t speck I is, but it make my
flesh crawl fer ter hear folks callin’ on dead
niggers ter do dis en do dat.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Judge had sallied forth
from the house, and was proceeding in the
direction of the Bascom Place. His step
was firm and elastic, his bearing dignified.
The acquaintances whom he met on his way
stopped and looked after him when they had
returned his Chesterfieldian salutation. He
walked rapidly, and there was an air of decision
in his movements that had long been
lacking. At the great gate opening into the
avenue of the Bascom Place the Judge was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
met by Prince the mastiff, who gave him a
hospitable welcome, and gravely preceded
him to the house. Miss Sophie, Mr. Underwood’s
maiden sister, who was sitting in the
piazza, engaged on some kind of feminine
embroidery, saw the Judge coming, too late
to beat a retreat, so she merely whipped behind
one of the large pillars, gave her dress
a little shake at the sides and behind, ran
her hands over her hair, and appeared before
the caller cool, calm, and collected.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, madam,” said the Judge
in his grand way, taking off his hat.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, sir,” said Miss Sophie.
“Have this chair?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said the Judge, smiling blandly,
and waving his hand. “I prefer my own
chair—the large rocker with the cushion,
you know. It is more comfortable.”</p>

<p>Somewhat puzzled, Miss Sophie fetched a
rocker. It had no cushion, but the Judge
seemed not to miss it.</p>

<p>“Why, where are the servants?” he
asked, his brows contracting a little. “I
could have brought the chair.”</p>

<p>“Mercy!” exclaimed Miss Sophie, “if I
were to sit down and expect the negroes to
wait on me, I’d have a good many disappointments
during the day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said the Judge, “that is very
true; very true. Where is Wesley?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” Miss Sophie
replied. “Is he a white man or a negro?”</p>

<p>“Wesley?” exclaimed the Judge. “Why,
he’s a nigger; he’s my body-servant.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t this Judge Bascom?” Miss Sophie
inquired, regarding him curiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly, madam,” responded the
Judge.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve seen a negro named Jesse
following you and your daughter about,”
said Miss Sophie. “Perhaps you are speaking
of Jesse.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said the Judge. “I mean
Wesley—or maybe you are only a visitor
here. Your face is familiar, but I have forgotten
your name.”</p>

<p>“I am Francis Underwood’s sister,” said
Miss Sophie, with some degree of pride.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes!” the Judge sighed—“Francis
Underwood. He is the gentleman who
has had charge of the place these several
years. A very clever man, I have no doubt.
He has done very well, very well indeed;
better than most men would have done. Do
you know where he will go next year?”</p>

<p>“Now, I couldn’t tell you, really,” Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Sophie replied, looking at the Judge through
her gold-rimmed eye-glasses. “He did intend
to go North this fall, but he’s always
too busy to carry out his intentions.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Judge Bascom; “I have no
doubt he is a very busy man. He has managed
everything very cleverly here, and I
wish him well wherever he goes.”</p>

<p>Miss Sophie was very glad when she
heard her brother’s step in the hall; not
that she was nervous or easily frightened,
but there was something in Judge Bascom’s
actions, something in the tone of his voice,
some suggestion in his words, that gave her
uneasiness, and she breathed a sigh of relief
when her stalwart brother made his appearance.</p>

<p>Francis Underwood greeted his guest
cordially—more cordially, Miss Sophie
thought, than circumstances warranted; but
the beautiful face of Mildred Bascom was
not stamped on Miss Sophie’s mind as it was
on her brother’s.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to put you to any inconvenience,”
said the Judge, after they had talked
for some time on commonplace topics—“very
sorry. I have put the matter off
until at last I felt it to be a solemn duty I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
owed my family to come here. Believe me,
sir,” he continued, turning to the young man
with some emotion—“believe me, sir, it
grieves me to trouble you in the matter, but
I could no longer postpone coming here. I
think I understand and appreciate your attachment”—</p>

<p>“Why, my dear sir,” cried Francis Underwood
in his heartiest manner, “it is no
trouble at all. No one could be more welcome
here. I have often wondered why you
have never called before. Don’t talk about
trouble and inconvenience.”</p>

<p>“I think I understand and appreciate
your attachment for the Place,” the Judge
went on as though he had not been interrupted,
“and it embarrasses me, I assure
you, to be compelled to trouble you now.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Francis Underwood, with a
hospitable laugh, “if it is no trouble to you,
it certainly is none to me. As my neighbors
around here say, when I call on them,
‘just make yourself at home.’”</p>

<p>Judge Bascom rose from his chair trembling.
He seemed suddenly to be laboring
under the most intense excitement.</p>

<p>“My home?” he almost shrieked—“make
myself at home! In God’s name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
man, what can you mean? It <em>is</em> my home!
It has always been my home! Everything
here is mine—every foot of land, every
tree, every brick and stone and piece of
timber in this house. It is <em>all</em> mine, and I
will have it! I have come here to assert
my rights!”</p>

<p>He panted with passion and excitement
as he looked from Francis Underwood to
Miss Sophie. He paused, as if daring them
to dispute his claims. Miss Sophie, who
had a temper of her own, would have given
the Judge a piece of her mind, but she saw
her brother regarding the old man with a
puzzled, pitying expression. Then the
truth flashed on her, and for an instant she
felt like crying. Francis Underwood approached
the Judge and led him gently
back to his chair.</p>

<p>“Now that you are at home, Judge Bascom,”
he said, “you need not worry yourself.”</p>

<p>“I tell you it is <em>mine</em>!” the Judge went
on, beating the arm of his chair with his
clenched fist; “it is mine. It has always
been mine, and it will always be mine.”</p>

<p>Francis Underwood stood before the old
man, active, alert, smiling. His sister said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
afterwards that she was surprised at the
prompt gentleness with which her brother
disposed of what promised to be a very disagreeable
scene.</p>

<p>“Judge Bascom,” said the young man,
swinging himself around on his boot-heels,
“as your guest here, allow me to suggest
that you ought to show me over the place.
I have been told you have some very fine
cows here.”</p>

<p>Immediately Judge Bascom was himself
again. His old air of dignity returned, and
he became in a moment the affable host.</p>

<p>“As my guests here,” he said, smiling
with pleasure, “you and the lady are very
welcome. We keep open house at the Bascom
Place, and we are glad to have our
friends with us. What we have is yours. I
suppose,” he went on, still smiling, “some
of our neighbors have been joking about our
cows. We have a good many of them, but
they don’t amount to much. They have
been driven to the pasture by this time, and
that is on the creek a mile and a half from
here. I wonder where Wesley is! I think
he is growing more worthless every year.
He ought to be here with my daughter.
The carriage was sent for her some time
ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“I will see if he is in the yard,” said Underwood,
and his sister followed him through
the hall.</p>

<p>“Mercy!” Miss Sophie exclaimed when
they were out of hearing; “does the old
Judge purpose to swarm and settle down on
us?” She had an economical turn of mind.
“What in the world is the matter with
him?”</p>

<p>“I pity him from the bottom of my
heart,” said Francis Underwood, “but I am
sorrier for his daughter. Everything seems
to be blotted out of his mind except the notion
that he is the owner of this Place. We
must humor him, sister, and we must be tender
with the daughter. You know how to
do that much better than I do.”</p>

<p>Miss Sophie frowned a little. The situation
was a new and trying one, but she had
been confronted with emergencies before,
and her experience and her strong common
sense stood her in good stead now. With a
woman’s promptness she decided on a line
of action at once sympathetic and effectual.
The buggy was ordered out and young Underwood
went for a physician.</p>

<p>Then, when he had returned, Miss Sophie
said he must go for the daughter, and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
cautioned him, with some severity of manner,
as to what he should say and how he
should deport himself. But at this Francis
Underwood rebelled. Ordinarily he was a
very agreeable and accommodating young
fellow, but when his sister informed him
that he must fetch Mildred Bascom to her
father, he pulled off his hat and scratched
his blond head in perplexity.</p>

<p>“What could I say, sister?” he protested.
“How could I explain the situation?
No; it is a woman’s work, and you
must go. It would be a pretty come-off for
me to go after this poor girl and in a fit of
awkwardness frighten her to death. It is
bad enough as it is. There is no hurry.
You shall have the carriage. It would
never do for me to go; no one but a woman
knows how to be sympathetic in a matter of
this kind.”</p>

<p>“I never knew before that you were so
bashful,” said Miss Sophie, regarding him
keenly. “It is a recent development.”</p>

<p>“It is not bashfulness, sister,” said Underwood,
coloring a little. “It is consideration.
How could I explain matters to this
poor girl? How could I prevail on her to
come here without giving her an inkling of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the situation, and thus frighten her, perhaps
unnecessarily?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right,” said Miss Sophie,
who, as an experienced spinster, was
not always ready to make concessions of this
kind. “At any rate I’ll go for Miss Bascom,
and I think I can manage it without
alarming her; but the matter troubles me.
I hope the poor old Judge will not be a
dangerous guest.”</p>

<p>“There is not the slightest fear of that,”
said Francis Underwood. “He is too feeble
for that. When I placed my hand on
his shoulder just now he was all of a tremble.
He is no stronger than a little child,
and no more dangerous. Besides, the doctor
is with him.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Miss Sophie with a sigh,
“I’ll go. Women are compelled to do
most of the odd jobs that men are afraid to
take up; but I shiver to think of it. I
shall surely break down when I see that
poor child.”</p>

<p>“No,” said her brother, “you will not.
I know you too well for that. We must
humor this old man, and that will be for
me to do; his daughter must be left to
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>All this was no less the result of Francis
Underwood’s desire than of the doctor’s commands.
The old practitioner was noted for
his skill throughout the region, and after he
had talked with Judge Bascom he gave it as
his opinion that the only physic necessary in
the case was perfect rest and quiet, and that
these could be secured only by allowing the
old man to remain undisturbed in the belief
that he was once more the owner of the Bascom
Place.</p>

<p>“He’ll not trouble you for long,” said
Dr. Bynum, wiping his spectacles, “and
I’ve no doubt that whatever expense may
be incurred will be settled by his old
friends. Oh, Bascom still has friends
here,” exclaimed the doctor, misunderstanding
Underwood’s gesture of protest. “He
went wrong, badly wrong; but he is a
Southerner, sir, to the very core, and in the
South we are in the habit of looking after
our own. We may differ, sir, but when the
pinch comes you’ll find us together.”</p>

<p>The doctor’s lofty air was wholly lost on
his companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“My dear sir,” said Underwood, laying
his hand somewhat heavily on the doctor’s
shoulder, “what do you take me for? Do
you suppose that I intend to set up a hospital
here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, by no means, by no means,” said
Dr. Bynum, soothingly. “Not at all; in
fact, quite the contrary. As I say, you
shall be reimbursed for all”—</p>

<p>“Dr. Bynum,” said Underwood, with
some degree of emphasis, “permit me to remind
you that Judge Bascom is my guest.
There is no question of money except so far
as your bill is concerned, and that”—</p>

<p>“Now, now, my <em>dear</em> boy,” exclaimed the
old doctor, holding up both hands in a gesture
of expostulation, “don’t, <em>don’t</em> fly up!
What is the use? I was only explaining
matters; I was only trying to let you know
how we Southerners feel. You must have
noticed that the poor old Judge hasn’t been
treated very well since his return here. His
best friends have avoided him. I was only
trying to tell you that they hold him in high
esteem, and that they are willing to do all
they can for him.”</p>

<p>“As a Southerner?” inquired Underwood,
“or as a man?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” exclaimed Dr. Bynum.
“Don’t come running at me with your head
down and your horns up. We’ve no time
to fall into a dispute. You look after the
Judge as a Northerner, and I’ll look after
him as a Southerner. His daughter must
come here. He is very feeble. He has but
one irrational idea, and that is that he owns
the old Place. In every other particular
his mind is sound, and he will give you no
trouble. His idea must be humored, and
even then the collapse will come too soon
for that poor girl, his daughter—as lovely
a creature, sir, as you ever saw.”</p>

<p>This statement was neither information
nor news so far as Underwood was concerned.
“If I see her,” the old doctor
went on, with a somewhat patronizing air,
“I’ll try to explain matters; but it is a
very delicate undertaking, sir—very delicate.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Underwood; “there will be
no need for explanations. My sister will
go for Miss Bascom, and whatever explanations
may be necessary she will make at the
proper time.”</p>

<p>“An admirable arrangement,” said Dr.
Bynum with a grunt of satisfaction—“an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
admirable arrangement indeed. Well, my
boy, you must do the best you can, and I
know that will be all that is necessary. I
am sorry for Bascom, very sorry, and I’m
sorrier for his daughter. I’ll call again tonight.”</p>

<p>As Dr. Bynum drove down the avenue,
Underwood was much gratified to see Jesse
coming through the gate. The negro appeared
to be much perplexed. He took off
his hat as he approached Underwood, and
made a display of politeness somewhat unusual,
although he was always polite.</p>

<p>“Is you seed Marse Judge Bascom?” he
inquired.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Underwood. “He is in the
house yonder, resting himself. You seem
frightened; what is the trouble?”</p>

<p>“Well, suh, I ain’t had no such worriment
sence de Sherman army come ’long.
I dunner what got inter Marse Judge Bascom.
He been gwine on des like yuther
folks, settin’ ’roun’ en talkin’ ’long wid hisse’f,
en den all of er sudden he break out
en shave en dress hisse’f, en go visitin’ whar
he ain’t never been visitin’ befo’. I done
year ’im say p’intedly dat he ain’t never
gwine come yer les’n de Place b’long ter
’im. Do he look downhearted, suh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” said Underwood, “I can’t say that
he does. He seems to be very well satisfied.
He has called several times for Wesley.
I have heard you called Jesse, but
perhaps the Judge knows you as Wesley.
There are several negroes around here who
answer to different names.”</p>

<p>“No, suh,” said Jesse, scratching his
head. “I ain’t never been call Wesley
sence I been bornded inter de worl’. Dey
was er nigger name Wesley what use ter go
’long wid Marse Judge Bascom en wait on
’im when I wuz er little boy, but Wesley
done been dead too long ago ter talk about.
I dunner what make folks’s min’ drop back
dat ’a’way. Look like dey er sorter fumblin’
’roun’ tryin’ fer ter ketch holt er sump’n
ne’r what done been pulled up out’n reach.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Underwood, “the Judge is
in the house. See if he wants anything;
and if he asks about his daughter, tell him
she will be here directly.”</p>

<p>When Jesse went into the house he found
the Judge lying on a lounge in the hall.
His eyes were closed, and he seemed to be
dozing; but Jesse’s movements aroused
him.</p>

<p>“Ah! is that you, Wesley? Where is
your Miss Mildred?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>“She comin’, suh; she comin’ right now.”</p>

<p>“Very well, very well. You must make
yourself at home here,” he said to Francis
Underwood, who had followed Jesse. “I
am somewhat dilapidated myself, but my
daughter will entertain you. Wesley, I believe
I will go to my room. Lend me your
arm.”</p>

<p>“Allow me to assist you,” said Underwood;
and so between the two the old man
was carried to the room that had been his
own when the house was his. It happened
to be Underwood’s room, but that made no
difference. It belonged once more to the
Judge in his disordered fancy, and thither
he went.</p>

<p>After a while Miss Sophie came, bringing
Mildred. Just how she had explained matters
to the poor girl no one ever knew, but
it must have been in some specially sympathetic
way, for when Francis Underwood
assisted the ladies from the carriage Miss
Bascom appeared to be the less agitated of
the two.</p>

<p>“The Judge is as comfortable as possible,”
Underwood said cheerily. “Jesse is
with him, and I think he is asleep. His
nervousness has passed away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, do you think he is seriously ill?”
exclaimed Mildred, clasping her hands together.</p>

<p>“Certainly not, just now,” said Francis
Underwood. “The doctor has been here,
and he has gone away apparently satisfied.
Sister, do you take charge of Miss Bascom,
and show her how to be at home here.”</p>

<p>And so Judge Bascom and his beautiful
daughter were installed at the old Place.
Mildred, under the circumstances, would
rather have been elsewhere, but she was
practically under orders. It was necessary
to the well-being of her father, so the doctor
said, that he should remain where he
was; it was necessary that he should be humored
in the belief that he was the owner
of the old Place. It is only fair to say that
Miss Sophie Underwood and her brother
were more willing and anxious to enter into
this scheme than Mildred appeared to be.
She failed to comprehend the situation until
after she had talked with her father, and
then she was in despair. Judge Bascom
was the representative of everything substantial
and enduring in his daughter’s experience,
and when she realized that his
mind had been seized by a vagary she received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
a tremendous shock. But the rough
edges of the situation, so to speak, were
smoothed and turned by Miss Sophie, who
assumed motherly charge of the young girl.
Miss Sophie’s methods were so sympathetic
and so womanly, and she gave to the situation
such a matter-of-fact interpretation,
that the grief and dismay of the young girl
were not as overwhelming as they otherwise
would have been.</p>

<h3>VIII.</h3>

<p>Naturally all the facts that have just been
set down here were soon known to the inhabitants
of Hillsborough. Naturally, too,
something more than the facts was also
known and talked about. There was the
good old doctor ready to shake his head and
look mysterious, and there were the negroes
ready to give out an exaggerated version of
the occurrences that followed Judge Bascom’s
visit to his old home.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Major Jimmy Bass to his
wife, with something like a snort, “ef the
old Judge is gone there an’ took holt of
things, like they say, it’s bekaze he’s out’n
his mind. I wonder what in the round
world could ’a’ possessed him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“I ’spec’ he’s done drapt back into his
doltage,” said Farmer Joe-Bob Grissom,
who had gone to the major’s for the purpose
of discussing the matter. “An’ yit,
they do say that he’s got a clean title to
every bit of the prop’ty, ef you take into account
all that talk about his wife’s brother,
an’ sech like.”</p>

<p>“Well,” remarked the major grimly,
“Sarah there ain’t got no brother, an’ I
reckon I’m sorter pretected from them kind
of gwines-on.”</p>

<p>“Why, tooby shore you are,” said his
wife, who was the Sarah referred to; “but
I ain’t so mighty certain that I wouldn’t be
better off if I had a brother to follow you
around where the wimmen folks can’t go.
You’ve flung away many a bright dollar
that he might have picked up.”</p>

<p>“Who, Sarah?” inquired the major,
wincing a little.</p>

<p>“My brother,” returned Mrs. Bass.</p>

<p>“Why, you haven’t got a brother, Sarah,”
said Major Bass.</p>

<p>“More’s the pity,” exclaimed the major’s
wife. “I ought to have had one, a great
big double-j’inted chap. But you needn’t
tell me about the old Judge,” she went on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
“He tried to out-Yankee the Yankees up
yonder in Atlanty, an’ now he’s a-trying to
out-Yankee them down here. Lord! You
needn’t tell me a thing about old Judge
Bascom. Show me a man that’s been
wrapped up with the Radicals, and I’ll
show you a man that ain’t got no better
sense than to try to chousel somebody. I’d
just as lief see Underwood have the Bascom
Place as the old Judge, every bit and
grain.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hadn’t,” said the major emphatically.</p>

<p>“No, ner me nuther,” said Mr. Joe-Bob
Grissom. “Hit may be right, but hit don’t
look right. Pap used to say he’d never be
happy ontel the Bascoms come back inter
the’r prop’ty.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’s dead, ain’t he?” inquired
Mrs. Bass in a tone that showed she had the
best of the argument.</p>

<p>“Yessum,” said Mr. Grissom, shifting
about in his chair and crossing his legs, as
if anxious to dispose of an unpleasant subject,
“yessum, pap’s done dead.” To this
statement, after a somewhat embarrassing
silence, he added: “Pap took an’ died a
long time ago.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Bass in a gentler tone,
“and I’ll warrant you that when he died he
wasn’t pestered ’bout whether the Bascoms
owned the Place or not. Did he make any
complaints?”</p>

<p>“No’m,” replied Mr. Grissom in a reminiscent
way, “I can’t say that he did. He
jest didn’t bother about ’em. Hit looked
like they jest natchally slipped outer his
mind.”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly,” said Mrs. Bass, with
a little shake of her head; “they slipped
outer your pa’s mind, and now they say the
old Judge has slipped out of his own
mind.”</p>

<p>“Well, we needn’t boast of it, Sarah,”
remarked the major, with a feeble attempt
at severity. “Nobody knows the day when
some of us may be twisted around. We’ve
no room to brag.”</p>

<p>“No, we ain’t,” said his wife, bridling up.
“I’ve trembled for you a many a day when
you thought I was thinking about something
else,—a many a day.”</p>

<p>“Now you know mighty well, Sarah, that
no good-natured man like me ain’t a-gwine
to up an’ lose their mind, jest dry so,” said
the major earnestly. “They’ve got to have
some mighty big trouble.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mrs. Bass, grimly, “and they
have to have mind too, I reckon. Nobody
that never had a horse ever lost one.”</p>

<p>The major nodded his head at Joe-Bob
Grissom, as much as to say that it was only
a very able man who could afford to have
such a sprightly wife. The mute suggestion,
however, was lost on Grissom, who was
accustomed to taking life seriously.</p>

<p>“I hear a mighty heap of talk,” he said,
“but I ain’t never been so mighty certain
an’ shore that the old Judge is lost his
mind. There’d be lots of fun ef it should
happen to be that he had the papers all
made out in his pocket, an’ I’ve hearn some
hints that-a-way.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the more practical Mrs.
Bass, “he ain’t got no papers. The minute
I laid eyes on him after he came back here,
I says to Mr. Bass there, ‘Mr. Bass,’ says
I, ‘the old Judge has gone wrong in his upper
story.’ Ah, you can’t fool me. I know
a thing when I see it, more especially if I
look at it close. I’ve seen folks that had to
rub the silver off a thrip to tell whether it
was passable or not. I might be fooled
about the silver in a thrip, but you can’t
fool me about a grown man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nobody ain’t tryin’ to fool you, Sarah,”
said the major, with some show of spirit.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon not,” exclaimed Mrs.
Bass, somewhat contemptuously. “I’d like
to see anybody try to fool me right here in
my own house and right before my face.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t no tellin’,” said Mr. Joe-Bob
Grissom, in his matter-of-fact way,
ignoring everything that had been said,—“there
ain’t no tellin’ whether the old
Judge is got the papers or not. ’T would
be hard on Frank Underwood an’ his sister,
an’ they ain’t no better folks than them.
They don’t make no fuss about it, an’ they
don’t hang out no signs, but when you come
to a narrer place in the road where you
can’t go forrerd nor back’ards, an’ nuther
can you turn ’roun’, you may jest count on
them Underwoods. They’ll git you out ef
you can be got out, an’ before you can say
thanky-do, they’ll be away off yonder helpin’
some yuther poor creetur.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Major Bass, with an air of
independence, “I’m at the fust of it. It
may be jest as you say, Joe-Bob; but ef so,
I’ve never knowed it.”</p>

<p>“Hit’s jest like I tell you,” said Joe-Bob,
emphatically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, the Lord love us!” exclaimed
Mrs. Bass, “I hope it’s so, I do from the
bottom of my heart. It would be a mighty
queer world if it didn’t have some tender
spots in it, but you needn’t be afraid that
they’ll ever get as thick as the measles. I
reckon you must be renting land on the old
Bascom Place,” she went on, eyeing Mr.
Grissom somewhat sharply.</p>

<p>“Yessum,” said Joe-Bob, moving about
uneasily in his chair. “Yessum, I do.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Mrs. Bass smiled, and her
smile was more significant than anything she
could have said. It was disconcerting indeed,
and it was not long before Mr. Joe-Bob
Grissom made some excuse for depriving
Major Jimmy and Mrs. Sarah Bass of
his company.</p>

<p>As he was passing the Bascom Place on
his way home he saw lights in the house and
heard voices on the piazza.</p>

<p>“Ef it warn’t for that blamed dog,” he
thought, “I’d go up there an’ see what they
er talkin’ about so mighty peart.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<h3>IX.</h3>

<p>But Mr. Grissom’s curiosity would not
have been satisfied. Judge Bascom was
sitting in a large rocking-chair, enjoying the
pleasant evening air, and the others were
sitting near, talking on the most ordinary
topics. This situation was one of the doctor’s
prescriptions, as Miss Sophie said.
Those around were to wear a cheerful air,
and the Judge was to be humored in the belief
that he was once more the proprietor of
the Bascom Place. He seemed to respond
to this treatment in the most natural way.
The old instinct of hospitality rose in him
and had its way. He grew garrulous indeed,
and sat on the piazza, or walked up
and down and talked by the hour. He was
full of plans and projects, and some of them
were so suggestive that Francis Underwood
made a note of them for further consideration.
The Judge was the genial host, and
while his daughter was full of grief and humiliation
at the position in which she was
placed, he appeared to draw new life and inspiration
from his surroundings. He took
a great fancy to Miss Sophie: her observations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
which were practical in the extreme,
and often unflattering, were highly relished
by him. The Judge himself was a good
talker, and he gave Miss Sophie an opportunity
to vent some of her pet opinions, the
most of which were very pronounced.</p>

<p>As for Mildred, in spite of her grief and
anxiety, she found her surroundings vastly
more pleasant than she had at first imagined
they could be. Some instinct or prepossession
made her feel at home in the old house,
and as she grew more cheerful and more
contented she grew more beautiful and more
engaging. At least, this was the opinion of
Francis Underwood.</p>

<p>“Brother,” said Miss Sophie one day
when they were together, “you are in love.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether to say yes or no,”
he replied. “What is it to be in love?”</p>

<p>“How should I know?” exclaimed Miss
Sophie, reddening a little. “I see you
mooning around, and moping. Something
has come over you, and if it isn’t love, what
is it?”</p>

<p>He held up his hands, white and muscular,
and looked at them. Then he took off
his hat and tousled his hair in an effort to
smooth it with his fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is something,” he said after a while
“but I don’t know what. Is love such an
everyday affair that it can be called by
name as soon as it arrives?”</p>

<p>“Don’t be absurd, brother,” said Miss
Sophie, with a gesture of protest. “You
talk as if you were trying to take a census
of the affair.”</p>

<p>“No,” said he; “I am trying to get a
special report. I saw Dr. Bynum looking
at you over his spectacles yesterday.”</p>

<p>Miss Sophie tried to show that this suggestion
was an irritating one, but she failed,
and then fell to laughing.</p>

<p>“I never knew I was so full of humor before,”
said Francis Underwood, by way of
comment.</p>

<p>“And I never knew you could be so foolish—to
me,” said Miss Sophie, still laughing.
“What is Dr. Bynum to me?”</p>

<p>“Not having his spectacles to look over,
how do I know?”</p>

<p>“But,” persisted Miss Sophie, “you need
no spectacles to look at Mildred. I have
seen you looking at her through your fingers.”</p>

<p>“And what was she doing?” inquired
Underwood, coloring in the most surprising
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh,” said Miss Sophie, “she was pretending
not to notice it; but I can sit with
my back to you both and tell by the tone of
her voice when this and that thing is going
on.”</p>

<p>“This, then, is courtship,” said Underwood.</p>

<p>“Why, brother, how provoking you are!”
exclaimed Miss Sophie. “It is nothing of
the sort. It is child’s play; it is the way
the youngsters do at school. I feel as if I
never knew you before; you are full of surprises.”</p>

<p>“I surprise myself,” he said, with something
like a sigh, “and that is the trouble;
I don’t want to be too surprising.”</p>

<p>“But in war,” said his sister, “the successful
general cannot be too full of surprises.”</p>

<p>“In war!” he cried. “Why, I was in
hopes the war was over.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking about the old saying,”
she explained—“the old saying that all is
fair in love and war.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Francis Underwood, “it
would be hard to say whether you and Dr.
Bynum are engaged in war or not. You
are both very sly, but I have seen a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
deal of skirmishing going on. Will it end
in a serious engagement, with casualties on
both sides? The doctor is something of a
surgeon, and he can attend to his own wounds,
but who is going to look after yours?”</p>

<p>“How can you go on so!” cried Miss Sophie,
laughing. “Are we to have an epidemic
of delusions?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and illusions too,” said her brother.
“The atmosphere seems to be full of them.
Everything is in a tangle.”</p>

<p>And yet it was not long after this conversation
that Miss Sophie observed her brother
and Mildred Bascom sauntering together
under the great cedars, and she concluded
that he was trying to untangle the tangle.</p>

<p>There were many such walks, and the old
Judge, sitting on the piazza in bright
weather, would watch the handsome pair,
apparently with a contented air. There was
something about this busy and practical
young man that filled Mildred’s imagination.
His individuality was prominent enough to
be tantalizing. It was of the dominant variety.
In him the instinct of control and
command, so pleasing to the feminine
mind, was thoroughly developed, and he disposed
of his affairs with a promptness and
decisiveness that left nothing to be desired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
Everything seemed to be arranged in his
mind beforehand.</p>

<p>Everything, that is to say, except his relations
with Mildred Bascom. There was not
the slightest detail of his various enterprises,
from the simplest to the most complicated,
with which he was not thoroughly familiar,
but this young girl, simple and unaffected as
she was, puzzled him sorely. She presented
to Francis Underwood’s mind the old problem
that is always new, and that has as
many phases as there are stars in the sky.
Here, before his eyes, was a combination for
which there was no warrant in his experience—the
wit and tenderness of Rosalind,
blended with the self-sacrificing devotion of
Cordelia. Here was a combination—a complication—of
a nature to attract the young
man’s attention. Problem, puzzle, what you
will, it was a very attractive one for him,
and he lost no favorable opportunity of
studying it.</p>

<p>So the pleasant days came and went. If
there were any love-passages between the
young people, only the stately cedars or the
restless poplars were in the secret, and these
told it only to the vagrant west winds that
crept over the hills when the silence of night
fell over all things.</p>

<h3>X.</h3>

<p>Those were pleasant days and nights at
the old Bascom Place, in spite of the malady
with which the Judge was afflicted. They
were particularly pleasant when he seemed
to be brighter and stronger. But one day,
when he seemed to be at his best, the beginning
of the end came. He was sitting on
the piazza, talking with his daughter and
with Francis Underwood. Some reference
was made to the Place, when the old Judge
suddenly rose from his chair, and, shaking
his thin white hand at the young man, cried
out:</p>

<p>“I tell you it is mine! The Place always
has been mine and it always will be mine.”</p>

<p>He tottered forward and would have fallen,
but Underwood caught him and placed
him in his chair. The old man’s nerves had
lost their tension, his eyes their brightness.
He could only murmur indistinctly, “Mine,
mine, mine.” He seemed suddenly to have
shrunk and shriveled away. His head fell to
one side, his face was deadly pale, his lips were
blue, and his thin hands clutched convulsively
at his clothes and at the chair. Mildred
was at his side instantly, but he seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
to be beyond the reach of her voice and beyond
the limits of her grief, which was distressful
to behold. He tried indeed to
stroke the beautiful hair that fell loosely
over him as his daughter seized him in her
despairing arms, but it was in a vague and
wandering way.</p>

<p>Judge Bascom’s condition was so alarming
that Francis Underwood lifted him in
his arms and placed him on the nearest bed,
where he lay gazing at the ceiling, sometimes
smiling and at other times frowning and
crying, “Mine, mine, mine!”</p>

<p>He sank slowly but surely. At the last
he smiled and whispered “Home,” and so
passed away.</p>

<p>He was indeed at home. He had come to
the end of his long and tiresome journey.
He smiled as he lay sleeping, and his rest
was pleasant; for there was that in his dead
face, white and pinched as it was, that bore
witness to the infinite gentleness and mercy
of Christ, who is the Lord.</p>

<p>It was an event that touched the hearts
of his old neighbors and their children, and
they spoke to one another freely and feelingly
about the virtues of the old Judge, the
beautiful life he had lived, the distinction he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
had won, and the mark he had made on his
generation. Some, who were old enough to
remember, told of his charities in the days
when prosperity sat at his board; and in
discussing these things the people gradually
came to realize the fact that Judge Bascom,
in spite of his misfortunes, had shed lustre
on his State and on the village in which he
was born, and that his renown was based on
a character so perfect, and on results so just
and beneficent, that all could share in it.</p>

<p>His old neighbors, watching by him as he
lay smiling in his dreamless sleep, shortened
the long hours of the night with pleasant
reminiscences of the dead. Those who sat
near the door could see, in an adjoining
room, Mildred Bascom sitting at Miss Sophie
Underwood’s feet, her arms around the
older woman’s waist. It was a brief and
fleeting panorama, as indeed life itself is,
but the two, brought together by grief and
sympathy, often sat thus in the years that
followed. For Mildred Bascom became the
mistress of the Bascom Place; and although
she has changed her name, the old name
still clings to Underwood’s domain.</p>
